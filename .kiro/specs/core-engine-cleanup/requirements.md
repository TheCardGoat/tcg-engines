# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The core-engine codebase has accumulated duplicated type definitions, unused imports, and redundant code patterns that reduce maintainability and increase the risk of inconsistencies. This cleanup initiative aims to consolidate duplicate code, remove unused elements, and establish consistent patterns across the codebase while maintaining full functionality and type safety.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Consolidate Duplicate Type Definitions

**User Story:** As a developer working on the core-engine, I want consistent type definitions across all modules, so that I don't encounter conflicting or duplicate type declarations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining type definitions THEN there SHALL be only one canonical definition for each type
2. WHEN a type is used across multiple files THEN it SHALL be imported from a single source of truth
3. WHEN PlayerID/PlayerId types are referenced THEN they SHALL use a consistent naming convention and import source
4. WHEN InstanceId types are used THEN they SHALL be imported from a centralized location
5. IF a type is only used in one file THEN it SHALL be defined locally rather than exported

### Requirement 2: Remove Unused Imports and Exports

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the codebase, I want clean import/export statements, so that the dependency graph is clear and build times are optimized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing import statements THEN unused imports SHALL be removed
2. WHEN examining export statements THEN unused exports SHALL be removed
3. WHEN checking circular dependencies THEN they SHALL be eliminated or properly documented
4. WHEN reviewing re-exports THEN unnecessary re-export chains SHALL be simplified
5. IF an import is only used for types THEN it SHALL use `import type` syntax

### Requirement 3: Eliminate Redundant Code Patterns

**User Story:** As a developer extending the engine, I want consistent code patterns and utilities, so that I can follow established conventions without duplicating functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN similar utility functions exist THEN they SHALL be consolidated into shared utilities
2. WHEN duplicate validation logic is found THEN it SHALL be extracted to reusable functions
3. WHEN similar error handling patterns exist THEN they SHALL use consistent error types and messages
4. WHEN context creation patterns are duplicated THEN they SHALL use shared factory functions
5. IF multiple files implement similar interfaces THEN they SHALL extend common base interfaces

### Requirement 4: Consolidate Card-Related Abstractions

**User Story:** As a game developer using the engine, I want a clear and consistent card abstraction system, so that I can choose the appropriate pattern for my use case without confusion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining card classes THEN there SHALL be clear separation between CoreCardInstance and GameCard patterns
2. WHEN card context is needed THEN there SHALL be a single recommended approach for accessing engine state
3. WHEN card filtering is implemented THEN duplicate filter logic SHALL be consolidated
4. WHEN card operations are performed THEN they SHALL use consistent interfaces and error handling
5. IF both WeakRef and context injection patterns exist THEN their use cases SHALL be clearly documented

### Requirement 5: Streamline Error Hierarchy

**User Story:** As a developer handling errors in the engine, I want a clean and logical error hierarchy, so that I can catch and handle specific error types appropriately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN error types are defined THEN duplicate error classes SHALL be consolidated
2. WHEN error messages are created THEN they SHALL follow consistent formatting patterns
3. WHEN error context is provided THEN it SHALL include relevant debugging information
4. WHEN error categories overlap THEN they SHALL be merged or clearly differentiated
5. IF error types are unused THEN they SHALL be removed or marked as deprecated

### Requirement 6: Optimize Test Infrastructure

**User Story:** As a developer writing tests, I want efficient and reusable test utilities, so that I can focus on testing business logic rather than setup code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN test utilities are duplicated THEN they SHALL be consolidated into shared test helpers
2. WHEN mock objects are created THEN they SHALL use factory functions for consistency
3. WHEN test engines are initialized THEN they SHALL use standardized configuration patterns
4. WHEN test data is needed THEN it SHALL be generated using reusable fixtures
5. IF test files contain unused helper functions THEN they SHALL be removed

### Requirement 7: Maintain Backward Compatibility

**User Story:** As a developer using the core-engine in existing projects, I want the cleanup to preserve all public APIs, so that my existing code continues to work without modifications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN public interfaces are modified THEN they SHALL maintain backward compatibility
2. WHEN types are consolidated THEN existing type aliases SHALL be preserved for compatibility
3. WHEN exports are removed THEN they SHALL only be internal/private exports
4. WHEN functions are refactored THEN their public signatures SHALL remain unchanged
5. IF breaking changes are necessary THEN they SHALL be clearly documented with migration paths
