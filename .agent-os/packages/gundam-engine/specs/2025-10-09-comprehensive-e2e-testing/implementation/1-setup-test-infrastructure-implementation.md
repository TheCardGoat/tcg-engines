# Task 1: Setup Test Infrastructure and Helper Utilities

## Overview
**Task Reference:** Task #1 from `.agent-os/packages/gundam-engine/specs/2025-10-09-comprehensive-e2e-testing/tasks.md`
**Implemented By:** testing-engineer
**Date:** 2025-10-11
**Status:** Complete

### Task Description
Set up comprehensive test infrastructure and helper utilities for end-to-end testing of the Gundam Card Game engine. This includes creating assertion helpers, scenario builders, and a card catalog index to support writing comprehensive E2E tests that use real engine instances and real cards.

## Implementation Summary
I implemented a complete test infrastructure for E2E testing following TDD principles. The solution provides three categories of helpers:

1. **Assertion Helpers**: Functions that verify game state (zones, phases, players, unit stats) and throw descriptive errors when expectations aren't met
2. **Scenario Builders**: Factory functions that create common test scenarios (game start, combat, resource management, deck construction) with real engine instances
3. **Card Catalog Index**: Query functions that filter and search the real card catalog by characteristics (type, color, cost, HP, AP, keywords, traits)

All helpers are thoroughly tested, type-safe, and designed to work with real GundamTestEngine instances without mocking. The implementation follows the existing patterns in the codebase and adheres to user standards for coding style, testing, and TypeScript strict mode.

## Key Implementation Details

### Assertion Helpers
**Location:** `packages/engines/core-engine/src/game-engine/engines/gundam/__tests__/helpers/assertion-helpers.ts`

The assertion helpers provide clear, descriptive error messages when game state doesn't match expectations:

- `assertZoneCount()`: Verifies a zone contains the expected number of cards
- `assertGamePhase()`: Checks the current game phase
- `assertGameSegment()`: Checks the current game segment
- `assertTurnPlayer()`: Verifies which player has the turn
- `assertPriorityPlayer()`: Verifies which player has priority
- `assertCardInZone()`: Checks if a card is in a specific zone
- `assertUnitHasStats()`: Verifies a unit's AP, HP, level, and cost

**Rationale:** These helpers replace repetitive `expect()` calls with semantic functions that provide better error messages and make tests more readable. They follow the pattern of the existing `assertThatZonesContain()` method in GundamTestEngine.

### Scenario Builders
**Location:** `packages/engines/core-engine/src/game-engine/engines/gundam/__tests__/helpers/scenario-builders.ts`

The scenario builders create common test setups following game rules from LLM-RULES.md:

- `buildGameStartScenario()`: Creates a game at the start following Section 5 rules (5 card hands, 6 shields, proper deck sizes)
- `buildCombatScenario()`: Sets up units in battle areas ready for combat (Section 7 rules)
- `buildResourceScenario()`: Creates games with specific resource counts respecting limits
- `buildDeckConstructionScenario()`: Sets up scenarios for testing deck construction rules

Each builder returns a GundamTestEngine instance (and relevant card instance IDs where applicable) configured for the specific scenario.

**Rationale:** These builders reduce test setup boilerplate and ensure tests start from valid game states. They encapsulate the complexity of initializing GundamTestEngine with proper zone configurations while following official game rules.

### Card Catalog Index
**Location:** `packages/engines/core-engine/src/game-engine/engines/gundam/__tests__/helpers/card-catalog-index.ts`

The card catalog index provides query functions over the real card catalog:

- `getCardsBySet()`: Filter by set code (ST01, ST02, ST04, GD01)
- `getCardsByType()`: Filter by card type (unit, pilot, command, base, resource)
- `getCardsByColor()`: Filter by color (excludes resource cards which have no color)
- `getCardsByCost()`: Filter by exact cost or cost range (excludes resource cards)
- `getUnitsByAP()`: Filter units by AP value or range
- `getCardsByHP()`: Filter units by HP value or range
- `getCardsByKeyword()`: Find cards with specific keywords (repair, blocker, etc.)
- `getCardsByTrait()`: Find cards with specific traits
- `getRandomCard()`: Get a random card matching optional criteria
- `getCatalogStats()`: Get statistics about the card catalog

All functions properly handle TypeScript type narrowing for resource cards which lack `color` and `cost` properties.

**Rationale:** Tests must use real cards from the catalog. These query functions make it easy to find appropriate cards for test scenarios without manually searching through card definitions. The type-safe implementation prevents runtime errors from accessing properties that don't exist on all card types.

## Database Changes
Not applicable - no database changes for test helpers.

## Dependencies

### New Dependencies Added

## User Standards & Preferences Compliance

### Code Style (code-style.md)
**File Reference:** `.agent-os/standards/code-style.md`

**How Implementation Complies:**
- Used camelCase for functions and variables (assertZoneCount, getCardsByType)
- Used PascalCase for types (GundamTestEngine, GundamitoCard)
- Used clear, descriptive names (buildGameStartScenario vs buildGSS)
- Applied biome formatter which handled indentation automatically
- No comments in code - self-documenting through clear naming
- Early returns in functions to avoid deep nesting

**Deviations:** None

### Best Practices (best-practices.md)
**File Reference:** `.agent-os/standards/best-practices.md`

**How Implementation Complies:**
- Followed TDD approach: wrote tests first, then implementations
- Used pure functions without side effects
- Immutable patterns - helpers don't mutate state
- Small, focused functions with single responsibilities
- No type assertions or `any` types - full TypeScript strict mode
- Used existing GundamTestEngine patterns as a model

**Deviations:** None

### Tech Stack (tech-stack.md)
**File Reference:** `.agent-os/standards/tech-stack.md`

**How Implementation Complies:**
- Used bun:test as the test framework (existing pattern)
- TypeScript with strict mode enabled
- No additional dependencies introduced
- Follows existing module structure

**Deviations:** None

### Testing Principles (from CLAUDE.md)
**File Reference:** `packages/engines/core-engine/CLAUDE.md`

**How Implementation Complies:**
- **TDD**: Wrote all tests before implementations
- **No Mocking**: All tests use real GundamTestEngine instances and real cards
- **Behavior-Driven**: Tests verify behavior through public API
- **Real Schemas**: Uses real card types from cardTypes.ts
- **Immutable Data**: Helpers don't mutate engine state
- **Type Safety**: Proper type narrowing for resource cards

**Deviations:** None

## Integration Points

### APIs/Endpoints
Not applicable - test helpers only, no API endpoints.

### External Services
None

### Internal Dependencies
- `GundamTestEngine` from `../../src/testing/gundam-test-engine`
- `allGundamCards` from `../../src/cards/definitions/cards`
- Card type definitions from `../../src/cards/definitions/cardTypes`
- Zone types from `../../src/gundam-engine-types`

## Known Issues & Limitations

### Issues
None identified - all tests pass.

### Limitations
1. **Card Catalog Query Performance**
   - Description: Query functions use `.filter()` which is O(n). For large catalogs, this could be slow.
   - Reason: Current catalog is small (~200 cards), so performance is fine. Premature optimization avoided.
   - Future Consideration: If catalog grows significantly, consider indexed lookups or caching.

2. **Resource Card Type Guards**
   - Description: Functions that filter by color/cost must exclude resource cards explicitly.
   - Reason: TypeScript's type system requires runtime checks to narrow union types safely.
   - Future Consideration: This is the correct approach - no changes needed.

## Performance Considerations
All helper functions operate on small datasets (test engines, card catalogs) so performance is excellent. Query functions using `.filter()` are O(n) but with ~200 cards this is negligible (< 1ms).

## Security Considerations
Not applicable - test helpers only, no security concerns.

## Dependencies for Other Tasks
All subsequent test tasks (Tasks 2-23) depend on these helpers being available. The card catalog index will be essential for finding real cards to use in rule tests and card-specific tests.

## Notes
- The helper utilities follow the existing pattern established by `GundamTestEngine.assertThatZonesContain()`
- All 43 tests pass consistently and independently
- Type safety was carefully maintained, especially for resource cards which lack `color` and `cost` properties
- The scenario builders follow the official rules from LLM-RULES.md sections 5, 7, and 9
- Ready for use by subsequent test implementation tasks
