> Spec: Comprehensive End-to-End Testing for Gundam Card Game Engine
> Created: 2025-10-09

## Overview

Implement comprehensive end-to-end testing for the Gundam Card Game engine that validates ALL game rules and card mechanics. Tests will follow TDD principles, instantiate real board states, execute moves/actions through the engine API, and assert on expected results without mocking. This ensures complete coverage of the official Gundam Card Game rules and provides confidence in the engine's correctness.

## User Stories

### Test Engineer Story

As a test engineer, I want comprehensive end-to-end tests for all game rules and cards, so that I can verify the engine correctly implements the official Gundam Card Game mechanics and catch regressions early.

The workflow involves:
1. Reading game rules from LLM-RULES.md
2. Creating test scenarios that mirror real gameplay
3. Using GundamTestEngine to set up board states
4. Executing moves through the engine API
5. Asserting expected outcomes match official rules
6. Running tests as part of CI/CD pipeline

This solves the problem of ensuring engine correctness and preventing bugs from reaching production by validating every rule and card interaction through automated tests.

### Card Designer Story

As a card designer, I want each card's abilities tested end-to-end, so that I can confidently add new cards knowing the engine correctly implements their mechanics and they don't break existing functionality.

The workflow involves:
1. Defining new card abilities
2. Writing tests that exercise the card in real game scenarios
3. Testing interactions with existing cards
4. Validating keyword effects work correctly
5. Ensuring edge cases are handled properly

This solves the problem of card implementation bugs and unintended interactions by providing automated verification of each card's behavior.

### Developer Story

As a developer, I want rule-based integration tests, so that I can refactor the engine with confidence that existing behavior remains correct and all game rules are still satisfied.

The workflow involves:
1. Running comprehensive test suite before changes
2. Making engine improvements or refactorings
3. Running tests again to verify behavior unchanged
4. Using test failures to identify regressions
5. Maintaining 100% rule coverage

This solves the problem of breaking existing functionality during refactoring by providing a comprehensive safety net of behavior-driven tests.

## Spec Scope

1. **Core Game Rules Testing** - Test all 99 rules from LLM-RULES.md covering game initialization, turn structure, phase progression, and win/loss conditions through end-to-end scenarios
2. **Combat System Testing** - Validate complete attack/block flow including damage calculation, keyword effects, priority handling, and multi-unit battles
3. **Zone Management Testing** - Test card movement between zones, zone limits, visibility rules, and automatic zone management
4. **Card Type Mechanics** - Validate Unit deployment, Pilot pairing, Command activation, Base placement, and Resource management through gameplay scenarios
5. **Keyword Effect Testing** - Test all keyword effects (<Repair>, <Breach>, <Support>, <Blocker>, <First Strike>, <High-Maneuver>) in combat and non-combat contexts
6. **Effect System Testing** - Validate triggered, activated, and constant effects with proper priority, targeting, and resolution order
7. **Individual Card Testing** - Create end-to-end tests for every card in ST01, ST02, ST03, ST04, and GD01 sets validating their unique abilities
8. **Action Step Testing** - Test priority passing, effect stacking, and resolution during action steps throughout game phases
9. **Resource System Testing** - Validate resource placement, EX Resource mechanics, and cost payment through complete game scenarios
10. **Game Flow Integration** - Test complete game scenarios from setup through win conditions including all phases, steps, and segment transitions

## Out of Scope

- Unit testing of internal helper functions (covered through behavior tests)
- Performance benchmarking (separate concern)
- UI/presentation layer testing (engine only)
- Network/multiplayer infrastructure (engine is single-process)
- Card text parsing (already covered by existing text-parser tests)
- Mock-based testing (we use real engine instances)
- Code coverage metrics chasing (coverage emerges from behavior tests)

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Complete rule coverage** - Browser-testable assertion that all 99 rules from LLM-RULES.md are validated through end-to-end test scenarios
2. **All cards tested** - Every card from ST01, ST02, ST03, ST04, GD01 sets has at least one end-to-end test exercising its unique abilities in realistic game scenarios
3. **Test suite passes** - All tests pass with `bun test` and integrate into CI/CD pipeline with no failures
4. **Zero mocking** - All tests use real GundamTestEngine instances with actual board states, validating behavior through public API
5. **Documentation** - Test patterns and conventions documented for future card additions and rule expansions
