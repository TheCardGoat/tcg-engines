Tests validate game state setup rather than executing actual keyword behavior. Tests exist and pass but need behavioral tests that execute keyword mechanics (HP recovery, shield damage, AP bonuses, attack redirection, damage timing, blocker prevention, trigger conditions) once move API supports keyword system)

## Notes

- **Real Cards First**: Always prefer using real cards from the card catalog. Only create mock cards when no real card exists matching required characteristics.
- **Test Independence**: Each test must be independent and use its own GundamTestEngine instance.
- **No Skipped Tests**: Do not use `.skip()` on any tests in the main branch. All tests must pass.
- **Deterministic**: Use the same seed for RNG to ensure reproducible test results.
- **TDD Approach**: Write tests first for each task before implementing or verifying functionality.
