# Spec Summary (Lite)

Implement comprehensive end-to-end testing for the Gundam Card Game engine validating ALL 99 game rules and every card's abilities through behavior-driven tests. Tests instantiate real board states using GundamTestEngine, execute moves through the engine API, and assert expected outcomes without mocking, ensuring complete coverage and confidence in the engine's correctness.
