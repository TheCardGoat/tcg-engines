# Spec Summary (Lite)

Implement the complete turn-based game loop for Gundam Card Game, using @tcg/core,  including all 5 phases, 8 core moves, full battle system, and win/loss conditions to create a playable game without card abilities. This phase validates the @tcg/core framework's segment/phase/step architecture for complex TCG mechanics and establishes the foundation for future ability implementation. Success means playing a complete game from setup to victory with proper zone management, resource/cost validation, and rules enforcement.
