# Spec Summary (Lite)

Implement a comprehensive, type-safe ability system for the Gundam Card Game engine that eliminates `unknown` types and provides full TypeScript type safety through discriminated unions. The system covers all game mechanics including targets, conditions, durations, and effect actions, enabling compile-time exhaustiveness checking and direct execution paths from card definitions to engine runtime.
