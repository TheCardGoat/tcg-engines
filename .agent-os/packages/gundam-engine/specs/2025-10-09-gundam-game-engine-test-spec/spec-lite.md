# Spec Summary (Lite)

Create comprehensive end-to-end test specifications for the Gundam Card Game engine that validate all official rules through a consistent pattern: board instantiation → player action execution → state assertion. Tests use the existing core engine foundation to ensure immutability, determinism, and proper state transitions across all game systems including setup, turn flow, resources, battles, effects, and keyword mechanics.
