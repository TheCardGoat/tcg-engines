# Product Mission (Lite)

`@tcg/gundam` is a reference implementation of the Bandai Gundam Card Game using the `@tcg/core` framework, demonstrating how to build production-ready trading card game engines with declarative game definitions, type-safe move systems, and deterministic state management. It serves as both a playable Gundam Card Game engine and a blueprint for implementing other TCGs with the framework.
