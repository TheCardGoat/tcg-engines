# Product Mission (Lite)

`@tcg/gundam` is a complete, production-ready implementation of the Gundam Card Game using the `@tcg/core` framework, serving as a reference implementation and validation test bed for the framework's extensibility and design patterns. It demonstrates how to handle complex card game mechanics including multi-zone combat, G-order system, and intricate ability timing while maintaining type safety and deterministic gameplay.
