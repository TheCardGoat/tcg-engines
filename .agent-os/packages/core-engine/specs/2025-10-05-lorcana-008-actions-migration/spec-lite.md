# Spec Summary (Lite)

Migrate all 27 action card definitions and tests from Lorcana Set 008 to the new Core Engine framework, ensuring 100% test coverage is maintained while updating APIs, card definitions, and framework capabilities. This one-by-one migration validates the framework's ability to handle real-world card effects and establishes patterns for migrating remaining Lorcana cards.
