# Set 007 Action Cards - Make Tests Pass

Make all Set 007 action card tests pass by copying missing dependency cards and implementing framework features. The 007 action cards already exist in new project - only their dependencies and framework features are missing.

## Key Points
- **Phase 1:** Scan all 007 action tests, identify missing character/item cards from other sets, copy full definitions from old project
- **Phase 2:** Work through each 007 action test, implement missing framework features until test passes
- NO action card migration needed (they already exist in new project)
- Copy full card definitions with abilities (not minimal stubs)
- Autonomous process without human confirmation unless stuck
- Focus: implement ONLY set 007 actions and their dependencies
