## Phase 1: Generic Framework Extraction

**Goal:** Transform Lorcana-specific implementation into a generic TCG framework
**Success Criteria:** Core engine is game-agnostic, at least 2 games can be fully implemented on the framework, all existing tests pass

### Framework Generalization

- [ ] **Extract Generic Card Model** - Remove Lorcana-specific card properties, create extensible base card interface with game-specific extension points `XL`
- [ ] **Generalize Game State** - Abstract player state, game state, and card metadata to support different TCG architectures `L`
- [ ] **Refactor Zone System** - Make zone definitions configurable per-game (different TCGs have different zones) `M`
- [ ] **Abstract Flow System** - Allow games to define custom segments, phases, and steps without modifying core engine `L`
- [ ] **Move System Generalization** - Ensure move validation and execution works for any TCG rule set `M`

### Documentation & Examples

- [ ] **Framework Documentation** - Comprehensive guide on creating new TCG engines using the framework `L`
- [ ] **API Reference** - Complete TypeDoc-generated API documentation with examples `M`
- [ ] **Starter Template** - Minimal TCG engine implementation template for quick starts `S`
- [ ] **Migration Guide** - Guide for converting Lorcana engine to use generic abstractions `S`

### Dependencies

- Refactoring existing code so all tests pass. We must have at least one test per card.

## Phase 2: Developer Experience & Tooling

**Goal:** Make the framework easy to adopt and iterate on
**Success Criteria:** New developers can implement a basic TCG in under 2 hours, comprehensive debugging support

### Developer Tools

- [ ] **Game State Debugger** - Visual debugger for inspecting game state, history, and move validation `L`
- [ ] **Move Enumeration Visualizer** - Tool to see all valid moves at any game state for testing `M`
- [ ] **Replay Viewer** - Visualize game replays from action logs for debugging and analysis `L`
- [ ] **Card Definition Validator** - CLI tool to validate card definitions against schema before runtime `S`

### Code Quality

- [ ] **Enable TypeScript Strict Mode** - Gradual migration to strict: true with branded types throughout `XL`
- [ ] **Remove Redux Dependency** - Complete migration to @tanstack/store `M`
- [ ] **Improve Test Coverage** - Achieve 95%+ behavior coverage across all core modules `L`
- [ ] **Performance Profiling** - Add telemetry and performance monitoring hooks `M`

### Documentation

- [ ] **Interactive Tutorial** - Step-by-step guide to building a simple TCG from scratch `L`
- [ ] **Video Walkthroughs** - Screen recordings showing common implementation patterns `M`
- [ ] **Troubleshooting Guide** - Common errors and solutions for TCG implementation `S`

### Dependencies

- Phase 1 must be complete for framework documentation to be accurate
- TypeScript strict mode requires significant refactoring effort

## Phase 3: Advanced Features & Optimization

**Goal:** Support production-scale TCGs with advanced features
**Success Criteria:** Framework handles 10,000+ concurrent games, supports AI opponents, extensible effect system

### Performance & Scale

- [ ] **State Compression** - Optimize state storage and transmission for large games `M`
- [ ] **Lazy Card Loading** - Load card definitions on-demand rather than all upfront `S`
