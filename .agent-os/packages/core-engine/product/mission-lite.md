# Product Mission (Lite)

Core Engine is a specialized framework for building trading card game (TCG) simulators that helps game developers, studios, and hobbyists create robust game engines by providing a battle-tested, extensible core with type-safe state management, move validation, and delta synchronization out of the box.

Core Engine serves TCG developers who need production-ready infrastructure without reinventing the wheel. Unlike general game frameworks like Board Game IO or Boardzilla, Core Engine is purpose-built for trading card games with specialized abstractions for card state, zone-based positioning, hierarchical game flow, and multiplayer synchronization. The framework is extracted from a battle-tested Disney Lorcana implementation, ensuring the architecture handles real-world complexity at scale.
