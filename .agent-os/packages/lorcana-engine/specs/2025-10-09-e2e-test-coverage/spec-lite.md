# Spec Summary (Lite)

Establish comprehensive end-to-end test coverage for the Lorcana engine ensuring all game rules and card abilities are validated through full game state simulations. Tests will use the TestEngine framework to instantiate board states, execute player actions, and assert expected outcomes, providing confidence that the engine correctly implements all Lorcana mechanics including turn structure, card abilities, keywords, and complex interactions.
