# Spec Summary (Lite)

Implement the complete Disney Lorcana card system with type-safe definitions for all 4 card types (Character, Action, Item, Location), all 11 keyword abilities (Bodyguard, Challenger, Evasive, Reckless, Resist, Rush, Shift, Singer, Sing Together, Support, Vanish, Ward), and full integration with @tcg/core's CardInstance and CardDefinition types. The system provides compile-time validation of card properties, runtime state management through immutable updates, and seamless compatibility with the framework's delta synchronization system.
