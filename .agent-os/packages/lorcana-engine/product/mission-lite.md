# Product Mission (Lite)

`@tcg/lorcana` is a reference implementation of Disney Lorcana using the `@tcg/core` framework, demonstrating how to build production-ready trading card game engines with declarative game definitions, type-safe move systems, and deterministic state management. It serves as both a playable Lorcana engine and a blueprint for implementing other TCGs with the framework.
