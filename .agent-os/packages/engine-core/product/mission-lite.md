# Product Mission (Lite)

`@tcg/core` is a universal, open-source TypeScript framework for building turn-based trading card games with first-class support for deterministic state management, delta-based synchronization, and turn/phase/step orchestration. It provides a robust, extensible core engine that enables TCG developers to rapidly prototype and ship production-ready games without reinventing complex state management, multiplayer sync, and flow control logic.
