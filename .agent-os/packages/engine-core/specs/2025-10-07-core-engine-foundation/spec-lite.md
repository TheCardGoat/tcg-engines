# Spec Summary (Lite)

Build the foundational `@tcg/core` engine with declarative GameDefinition pattern, Immer-based immutable state, and delta synchronization. Framework provides first-class TCG features: zone management (private/public/secret zones), card state tracking (tapped, counters, modifiers), card filtering DSL for queries, XState flow orchestration, seeded RNG for deterministic replay, and AI move enumeration. Eliminates the need to reinvent TCG infrastructure, state synchronization, and multiplayer systems.
