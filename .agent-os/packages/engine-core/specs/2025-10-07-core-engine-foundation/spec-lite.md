# Spec Summary (Lite)

Build the foundational `@tcg/core` engine with declarative GameDefinition pattern, type-safe move system, Immer-based immutable state, and delta synchronization. Framework enables TCG developers to define games declaratively with automatic move validation, state management, turn/phase/step orchestration, player view filtering, and replay supportâ€”eliminating the need to reinvent complex state synchronization and multiplayer infrastructure.
