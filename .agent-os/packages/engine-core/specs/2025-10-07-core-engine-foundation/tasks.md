## Notes

- Follow **strict TDD**: Write tests first, implement to pass tests, refactor if valuable
- Each major task builds on previous tasks (dependencies respected)
- Use **real engine instances** in tests, no mocking
- Tests document **expected behavior**, not implementation details
- **95%+ behavior coverage** is the goal
- All code must pass: tests, linter, type checker
- Example game (Task 15) validates the entire framework
- Integration tests (Task 16) verify systems work together
