# Code Quality Guidelines

## Verify Information
Always verify information before presenting it. Do not make assumptions or speculate without clear evidence. Ask the user for clarification if needed.

## File-by-File Changes
Make changes file by file and give me a chance to spot mistakes. If you fail to write a file, ensure you're using all the parameters needed to write the file and write on smaller chunks.

## No Apologies
Never use apologies.

## No Understanding Feedback
Avoid giving feedback about understanding in comments or documentation.

## No Whitespace Suggestions
Don't suggest whitespace changes.

## No Summaries
Don't summarize changes made.

## No Inventions
Don't invent changes other than what's explicitly requested.

## Preserve Existing Code
Don't remove unrelated code or functionalities. Pay attention to preserving existing structures.

## No Implementation Checks
Don't ask the user to verify implementations that are visible in the provided context.

## No Unnecessary Updates
Don't suggest updates or changes to files when there are no actual modifications needed.

## No Current Implementation
Don't show or discuss the current implementation unless specifically requested.
