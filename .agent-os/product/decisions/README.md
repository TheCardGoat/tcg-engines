# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records for the Lorcanito project. ADRs document significant architectural decisions made during development to maintain a historical record for future reference.

## ADR Index

| Number | Title | Status | Date | Context |
|--------|-------|--------|------|---------|
| | | | | |

*ADRs will be added chronologically as architectural decisions are made during spec creation and task execution.*

## ADR Guidelines

- **File Naming**: Use format `YYYY-MM-DD-decision-title.md`
- **Numbering**: Sequential ADR numbers (ADR-0001, ADR-0002, etc.)
- **Status Types**: Proposed, Accepted, Rejected, Deprecated, Superseded
- **Scope**: Document architecturally significant decisions only

## When to Create an ADR

### During Spec Creation:
- Technology stack changes or additions
- Data architecture or database design decisions
- API design patterns or communication protocols
- Security architecture choices
- Performance or scalability architecture decisions
- Integration patterns with external systems
- Deployment or infrastructure architecture

### During Task Execution:
- Technology choices or framework decisions
- Design pattern implementations
- Database schema or data modeling decisions
- API design or integration approach changes
- Security implementation strategies
- Performance optimization architectural choices
- Infrastructure or deployment pattern decisions

## ADR Template

See individual ADR files for the standard template structure, or refer to the [ADR best practices guide](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/joelparkerhenderson/architecture-decision-record/refs/heads/main/README.md).
