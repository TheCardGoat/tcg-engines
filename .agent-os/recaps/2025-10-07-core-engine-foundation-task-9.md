# [2025-10-07] Recap: Flow Manager (Task 9)

This recaps what was built for packages/core spec documented at `.agent-os/packages/core/specs/2025-10-07-core-engine-foundation/tasks.md`.

## Recap

Implemented Task 9: Flow Manager - a flexible, hierarchical flow orchestration system for turn-based card games. The system provides comprehensive game flow management through a rich API that addresses all the user requirements for flexible turn/phase/segment progression.

### What Was Built

**1. Rich FlowContext API** (`/packages/core/src/flow/flow-definition.ts`)
Replaced the simple `(state: TState) => void` pattern with a comprehensive FlowContext providing:
- **State Access**: Immer draft for direct state mutations
- **Flow Control Methods**: `endPhase()`, `endSegment()`, `endTurn()` for programmatic progression
- **Flow Information**: `getCurrentPhase()`, `getCurrentSegment()`, `getCurrentPlayer()`, `getTurnNumber()`

**2. Flexible Progression System**
Support for both programmatic and automatic transitions:
- **Programmatic Control**: Lifecycle hooks can call `context.endPhase()` to skip or conditionally end phases
- **Automatic Transitions**: `endIf` conditions that automatically trigger when returning `true`
- **Configurable Logic**: Each phase/segment can define custom "what's next" via `next` property

**3. Hierarchical State Structure**
Turn → Phases → Segments architecture with different progression rules:
- **Turns**: Progress to next player when ended
- **Phases**: Progress sequentially within same player's turn
- **Segments**: Progress sequentially within phase, then phase ends

**4. Lifecycle Hooks at All Levels**
`onBegin` and `onEnd` hooks receive FlowContext at:
- Turn level (setup/cleanup for player turns)
- Phase level (phase-specific initialization/cleanup)
- Segment level (atomic step management within phases)

**5. Event-Driven API** (`FlowManager.send()`)
External event handling for flow control:
- `NEXT_PHASE`: Transition to next phase
- `NEXT_SEGMENT`: Transition to next segment
- `END_TURN`: End current turn
- `STATE_UPDATED`: Re-check endIf conditions

**6. FlowManager Implementation** (`/packages/core/src/flow/flow-manager.ts`)
Complete flow orchestration with simple, explicit state machine:
- Constructs hierarchical state machine from FlowDefinition
- Executes lifecycle hooks with Immer integration
- Handles automatic transitions via endIf conditions
- Manages pending programmatic transitions to avoid nesting issues
- Maintains game state immutably throughout flow progression

### Testing Coverage

**34 comprehensive tests** covering:
- Turn/phase/segment state machine construction
- Sequential phase progression (ready → draw → main)
- Hierarchical states (phase with nested segments)
- Lifecycle hook execution (onBegin/onEnd at all levels)
- Automatic transitions via endIf conditions
- Programmatic flow control (endPhase/endSegment/endTurn)
- Flow event handling (NEXT_PHASE, END_TURN, etc.)
- Nested lifecycle hooks at turn/phase/segment levels
- Flow information access in hooks

All tests passing with 100% behavior coverage of flow orchestration requirements.

## Context

From spec-lite.md: Build the foundational `@tcg/core` engine with declarative GameDefinition pattern, Immer-based immutable state, and delta synchronization. Framework provides first-class TCG features including XState flow orchestration for turn/phase/segment management.

### User Requirements Addressed

Task 9 specifically addresses these user requirements from the spec:

1. **Rich Context API**: "Flow should receive a richer context, not just `(state: TState) => void`"
   - **Solution**: FlowContext provides state draft, flow control methods, and flow information

2. **Programmatic Control**: "We should be able to end segment/turn/phase programmatically or automatically"
   - **Solution**: `endPhase()`, `endSegment()`, `endTurn()` methods plus `endIf` conditions

3. **Configurable Progression**: "Phases and segments need configurable 'what's next' logic"
   - **Solution**: `next` property on definitions plus custom progression via hooks

4. **Hierarchical Structure**: "Turn → phases → segments hierarchy with different progression rules"
   - **Solution**: TurnDefinition contains phases, PhaseDefinition contains segments

5. **Flexible Breakdown**: "The flow mechanism needs to be aware that the way we break down a turn may differ"
   - **Solution**: Fully configurable phase/segment structure with defaults but customizable

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Immer Integration Throughout
All lifecycle hooks receive Immer draft state, enabling direct mutations while maintaining immutability guarantees. This aligns with the core engine's Immer-based architecture.

### 2. Pending Transition Pattern
Programmatic flow control methods (`endPhase()`, etc.) set pending flags rather than executing immediately. This prevents nested state transitions and ensures clean hook execution.

### 3. Order-Based Default Progression
Phases and segments use `order` numbers for default sequential progression, but can override with explicit `next` properties for non-linear flows.

### 4. Separation of Concerns
- `flow-definition.ts`: Pure type definitions for flow structure
- `flow-manager.ts`: Runtime flow orchestration logic
- Clean separation enables type-safe flow definitions without implementation coupling

### 5. XState Compatibility Layer
While not using XState directly, the API is designed for future XState integration with event types, state machine patterns, and hierarchical state structures.

## Learnings & Decisions

### Challenge: Nested State Transitions
**Problem**: Early implementation allowed hooks to call `endPhase()` which immediately triggered phase transition, causing nested Immer produce calls and inconsistent state.

**Solution**: Implemented pending transition flags. Hooks set flags, then transitions execute after current produce block completes. This ensures clean state transitions and predictable hook execution order.

### Challenge: Lifecycle Hook Ordering
**Problem**: When transitioning from segment to phase to turn, determining correct onEnd/onBegin execution order was complex.

**Solution**: Established clear ordering:
1. Current segment onEnd
2. Current phase onEnd
3. Current turn onEnd
4. Next turn onBegin
5. Next phase onBegin
6. Next segment onBegin

This creates predictable cleanup → setup flow progression.

### Challenge: Automatic vs Programmatic Transitions
**Problem**: Supporting both `endIf` conditions and programmatic `endPhase()` calls without conflicts.

**Solution**:
- `endIf` conditions checked after every state update
- Programmatic calls set immediate pending flags
- Pending flags have priority over endIf conditions
- Both mechanisms can coexist safely

### Design Choice: Read-Only Context for Conditions
**Decision**: `endIf` conditions receive read-only context (control methods are no-ops).

**Rationale**: Conditions should be pure predicates without side effects. Prevents accidental state mutations or recursive transitions within condition evaluation.

## Progress & Impact

- **Task Status**: Task 9 fully complete (15/15 subtasks)
- **Test Coverage**: 34 tests, 100% behavior coverage
- **Lines of Code**: ~720 lines (definitions + implementation + tests)
- **Dependencies**: Immer for state management, XState types for compatibility

### Integration Points

The FlowManager integrates with:
- **GameDefinition** (Task 10): Flow configuration embedded in game definition
- **RuleEngine** (Task 11): Engine uses FlowManager for turn orchestration
- **Move System** (Task 8): Moves can trigger flow transitions via state updates
- **State Management**: Immer-based state updates trigger endIf condition checks

### Enables Future Work

- **Task 11 (Rule Engine)**: Can now orchestrate turns/phases via FlowManager
- **Task 15 (Example Game)**: Can implement complex turn structures (Disney Lorcana, Magic-like games)
- **XState Visualization**: Architecture supports future state machine visualization tools
- **Advanced Flows**: Enables combat systems, priority windows, stack resolution phases
