# [2025-10-05] Recap: Lorcana Set 008 Actions Migration (Partial)

This recaps what was built for core-engine spec documented at .agent-os/packages/core-engine/specs/2025-10-05-lorcana-008-actions-migration/spec.md.

## Recap

Migrated 10 of 27 action cards (37%) from Lorcana Set 008 to the Core Engine framework, implementing several critical effect handlers along the way:

**Cards Migrated (10/27)**:
- 039-candy-drift: draw, stat buff, banish
- 040-she-s-your-person: modal effects, removeDamage
- 041-only-so-much-room: moveCard from multiple zones
- 042-it-means-no-worries: returnCard with upTo, costReduction
- 043-trials-and-tribulations: stat reduction (get effect)
- 077-forest-duel: gainsAbility for Challenger
- 078-they-never-come-back: restrict + draw
- 114-he-who-steals-and-runs-away: banish + draw
- 115-stopped-chaos-in-its-tracks: moveCard with filtering
- 150-twitterpated: gainsAbility for Evasive
- 203-quick-shot: dealDamage + draw

**Framework Features Implemented**:
- Modal effect handler (choose-one mechanics)
- removeDamage effect handler
- moveCard effect handler (zone transitions)
- costReduction effect handler
- gainsAbility effect handler (temporary ability grants)
- banish effect handler
- dealDamage effect handler
- followedBy effect chaining
- Enhanced target resolution (upTo, zone/type filtering)
- Updated hasChallenger and hasEvasive getters for granted abilities

**Test Results**: 10/10 migrated cards have passing tests (100% pass rate for completed cards)

**Remaining Work**: 17 cards blocked by missing framework features (discard from hand, deck manipulation, triggered abilities, conditional effects, etc.)

## Context

One-by-one migration of 27 action cards from Lorcana Disney 100 set to Core Engine framework. Goal is to update API usage, implement abilities arrays, and ensure 100% test coverage while building out framework effect handlers as needed. This is a stepping stone toward completing the full Lorcana implementation on the Core Engine.

## Known Issues

**Critical**: TestEngine ink calculation issue identified - expected 1 available ink but getting 8 available. This affects 210 test failures in the broader test suite. Requires investigation of TestEngine initialization logic.

## Next Steps

1. Fix TestEngine ink calculation issue
2. Continue migrating remaining 17 cards
3. Implement missing framework features (discard, deck manipulation, triggered abilities)
4. Run full test suite verification
