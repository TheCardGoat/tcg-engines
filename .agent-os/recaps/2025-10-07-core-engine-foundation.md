# [2025-10-07] Recap: Core Engine Foundation - Project Setup & Type System

This recaps what was built for the engine-core spec documented at `.agent-os/packages/engine-core/specs/2025-10-07-core-engine-foundation/spec.md`.

## Recap

Completed Task 1 of the core engine foundation spec, establishing the foundational infrastructure for the `@tcg/core` package. This includes:

- Created new `@tcg/core` package with proper monorepo configuration
- Configured TypeScript strict mode for maximum type safety
- Implemented branded types (CardId, PlayerId, GameId, ZoneId) with utility functions
- Set up Biome for linting and formatting
- Configured Turborepo boundaries to ensure package independence
- Achieved 100% test coverage (32 passing tests)
- All code passes strict TypeScript checks and linting rules

## Context

Build the foundational `@tcg/core` engine with declarative GameDefinition pattern, Immer-based immutable state, and delta synchronization. Framework provides first-class TCG features: zone management (private/public/secret zones), card state tracking (tapped, counters, modifiers), card filtering DSL for queries, XState flow orchestration, seeded RNG for deterministic replay, and AI move enumeration. Eliminates the need to reinvent TCG infrastructure, state synchronization, and multiplayer systems.

## Progress

Task 1 of 16 complete. The project setup and type system foundation is now in place, providing a solid base for building out the remaining 15 tasks of the engine core.
