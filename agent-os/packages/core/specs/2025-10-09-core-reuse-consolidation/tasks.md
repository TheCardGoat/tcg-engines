## Notes

- Follow TDD strictly: write tests before implementation
- Each major task builds on previous tasks
- Verify tests, linting, and type-checking after each task
- Use code-reviewer subagent for quality assurance
- Performance target: <5% regression acceptable
- Test coverage target: >95% for all new code
- Documentation must include runnable examples
- Migration guides must have before/after code examples
