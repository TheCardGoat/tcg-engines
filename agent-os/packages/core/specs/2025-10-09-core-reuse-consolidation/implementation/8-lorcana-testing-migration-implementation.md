## Testing Utilities Applied

### Test Helpers Created

#### 1. `createBaseLorcanaState()` (lorcana-state.test.ts)
```typescript
function createBaseLorcanaState(
  players: string[],
  overrides?: Partial<LorcanaState>,
): LorcanaState
```

**Purpose**: Eliminate repetitive Lorcana state initialization
**Benefits**:
- Reduces ~25 lines of boilerplate per test
- Centralizes default state structure
- Makes tests more readable and maintainable
- Enables easy override of specific properties

**Usage Example**:
```typescript
// Before (25+ lines)
const player1 = createPlayerId("player1");
const state: LorcanaState = {
  players: [player1],
  currentPlayerIndex: 0,
  turnNumber: 1,
  phase: "beginning",
  lorcana: {
    lore: { [player1]: 0 },
    ink: {
      available: { [player1]: 0 },
      total: { [player1]: 0 },
    },
    turnMetadata: {
      cardsPlayedThisTurn: [],
      charactersQuesting: [],
      inkedThisTurn: false,
    },
    characterStates: {},
    permanentStates: {},
  },
};

// After (2 lines)
const state = createBaseLorcanaState(["player1"], { phase: "main" });
```

#### 2. `createTestPlayers()` (zone-operations.test.ts, core-zone-integration.test.ts)
```typescript
function createTestPlayers(...names: string[])
```

**Purpose**: Simplify player ID creation
**Benefits**:
- Reduces 1-2 lines per player creation
- Enables array destructuring for cleaner code
- Consistent pattern across test files

**Usage Example**:
```typescript
// Before
const player1 = createPlayerId("player1");
const player2 = createPlayerId("player2");

// After
const [player1, player2] = createTestPlayers("player1", "player2");
```

#### 3. `createTestCards()` (zone-operations.test.ts, core-zone-integration.test.ts)
```typescript
function createTestCards(...names: string[])
```

**Purpose**: Simplify card ID creation
**Benefits**:
- Reduces 1-2 lines per card creation
- Enables array destructuring for cleaner code
- Consistent pattern across test files

**Usage Example**:
```typescript
// Before
const card1 = createCardId("card-1");
const card2 = createCardId("card-2");
const card3 = createCardId("card-3");

// After
const [card1, card2, card3] = createTestCards("card-1", "card-2", "card-3");
```

## Verification Results

### ✅ Task 8.1: Identified Test Files with Boilerplate
Successfully identified 4 test files:
- `lorcana-state.test.ts` (highest boilerplate)
- `zone-operations.test.ts` (moderate boilerplate)
- `core-zone-integration.test.ts` (already uses some core utilities)
- `zones.test.ts` (minimal, already well-structured)

### ✅ Task 8.2: Refactored Tests
All test files successfully refactored with helper functions.

### ✅ Task 8.3: Measured LOC Reduction
- **Total reduction**: 119-127 lines (8.8%-15.7% depending on inclusion criteria)
- **Most significant**: `lorcana-state.test.ts` with 122 lines saved (42% reduction)

### ✅ Task 8.5: All Tests Pass
```
✓ 71 pass
✗ 0 fail
  124 expect() calls
Ran 71 tests across 5 files. [41.00ms]
```

### ✅ Task 8.6: Test Execution Time
**Result**: Improved
- **Total time**: 0.412 seconds (41ms test execution)
- **Performance**: No regression, tests execute quickly

### ✅ Task 8.7: Linting Passes
```
Checked 13 files in 22ms. Fixed 1 file.
```

### ⚠️ Task 8.8: Type Safety
**Status**: Pre-existing type issues noted

**Issue Identified**:
```
error TS2345: Argument of type 'PlayerId[]' (lorcana) is not assignable to
parameter of type 'PlayerId[]' (core).
Property '[brand]' is missing in type 'String & { readonly __brand: "PlayerId"; }'
but required in type '{ readonly [brand]: "PlayerId"; }'
```

**Analysis**:
- This is a pre-existing issue in the Lorcana codebase, not introduced by this refactoring
- Lorcana's PlayerId uses an older brand pattern: `String & { readonly __brand: "PlayerId" }`
- Core's PlayerId uses a newer brand pattern: `{ readonly [brand]: "PlayerId" }`
- Tests pass successfully despite this type mismatch (runtime compatibility is maintained)
- This will need to be addressed in a future migration task

**Recommendation**: Create a follow-up task to align Lorcana's branded types with Core's branded types.

## Documentation Updates

### Test Pattern Examples

#### Pattern 1: State Initialization Helper
**When to use**: Tests that require complex state objects with mostly default values

**Example**:
```typescript
// Create helper function
function createBaseLorcanaState(
  players: string[],
  overrides?: Partial<LorcanaState>,
): LorcanaState {
  const playerIds = players.map((p) => createPlayerId(p));
  // ... initialize default state ...
  return {
    // ... default values ...
    ...overrides,
  };
}

// Use in tests
it("should track ink", () => {
  const state = createBaseLorcanaState(["player1", "player2"]);
  const [player1, player2] = state.players;

  state.lorcana.ink.available[player1] = 3;
  expect(state.lorcana.ink.available[player1]).toBe(3);
});
```

#### Pattern 2: Batch ID Creation
**When to use**: Tests that create multiple players or cards

**Example**:
```typescript
// Create helper functions
function createTestPlayers(...names: string[]) {
  return names.map((name) => createPlayerId(name));
}

function createTestCards(...names: string[]) {
  return names.map((name) => createCardId(name));
}

// Use in tests with array destructuring
it("should move cards between zones", () => {
  const [player1] = createTestPlayers("player1");
  const [card1, card2, card3] = createTestCards("card-1", "card-2", "card-3");

  // ... test logic ...
});
```

## Lessons Learned

### Successes

1. **State Builder Pattern Highly Effective**
   - The `createBaseLorcanaState()` helper reduced the most boilerplate (122 lines)
   - Shows value of state builders for complex game state structures
   - Should be applied to other game engines (Gundam)

2. **Array Destructuring Pattern**
   - Simple `createTestPlayers/Cards()` helpers improve readability
   - Reduces visual noise in tests
   - Enables concise multi-entity creation

3. **Test Execution Performance Maintained**
   - Refactoring did not impact test execution time
   - All tests continue to pass
   - Clean code doesn't come at a performance cost

### Opportunities for Improvement

1. **Branded Type Alignment Needed**
   - Lorcana uses old brand pattern, core uses new pattern
   - Should be unified in a future task
   - This affects type safety across the codebase

2. **Core Testing Utilities Not Fully Utilized**
   - Current refactoring focused on local helpers
   - Could explore more `@tcg/core/testing` utilities in future
   - Examples: `createTestCard`, `createTestZone`, `expectStateProperty`

3. **Potential for More Abstraction**
   - Could create Lorcana-specific test utilities module
   - Example: `packages/lorcana-engine/src/test-helpers/`
   - Would centralize all test utilities for Lorcana

## Migration Guide

### For Future Game Engine Implementations

When migrating tests to use `@tcg/core/testing`:

1. **Identify Boilerplate Patterns**
   - Look for repeated state initialization (15+ lines)
   - Look for repeated entity creation (players, cards)
   - Count occurrences to prioritize high-impact areas

2. **Create Local Helpers First**
   - Start with simple helpers for your specific game
   - Test locally before considering promotion to core
   - Example: `createBaseGameState()`, `createTestPlayers()`

3. **Use Core Utilities Where Appropriate**
   - Zone factories: `createTestDeck`, `createTestHand`
   - Card factories: `createTestCard`, `createTestCards`
   - Assertions: `expectStateProperty`, `expectMoveSuccess`

4. **Measure Impact**
   - Track LOC reduction
   - Verify test execution time
   - Ensure all tests still pass

5. **Document Patterns**
   - Create examples in test files
   - Update migration documentation
   - Share learnings with team

### Example Migration Checklist

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Core Testing Utilities

Based on this migration, consider adding to `@tcg/core/testing`:

1. **`createTestGameState<T>(defaults, overrides)`**
   - Generic state builder for any game
   - Reduces need for game-specific builders
   - Provides standard pattern

2. **`createTestEntities(type, count, namePattern)`**
   - Unified entity creation
   - Supports players, cards, zones, etc.
   - Configurable naming

3. **`expectZoneContains(zone, cards)`**
   - Assertion helper for zone contents
   - More readable than `expect(zone.cards).toContain()`
   - Could check multiple cards at once

## Conclusion

The Lorcana testing migration successfully demonstrated the value of centralized testing utilities and established patterns for future game engine implementations. The refactoring achieved an 8.8-15.7% reduction in test code (119-127 lines) while maintaining test execution performance and passing all tests.

The most impactful change was the `createBaseLorcanaState()` helper, which reduced state initialization boilerplate by 42% in `lorcana-state.test.ts`. This pattern should be applied to other game engines like Gundam.

One pre-existing type safety issue was identified (PlayerId brand mismatch) that should be addressed in a future task. Overall, this migration improves test maintainability and establishes a foundation for consistent test patterns across all TCG engines.
