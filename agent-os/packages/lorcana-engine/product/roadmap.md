- Basic move validation
- Setup and initialization

### Success Criteria
- Complete turn cycle playable
- Core mechanics tested with behavior tests
- Deterministic game state management
- Integration with RuleEngine successful

---

## Phase 3: Card System (Future)

### Scope

- Card filtering and queries
- Basic keyword abilities (Rush, Bodyguard, etc.)

### Success Criteria
- All card types representable
- Card instances properly managed in zones
- Keyword abilities functional
- Card queries working correctly

---

## Phase 4: Advanced Abilities (Future)

### Scope

- Set 2: Rise of the Floodborn (204 cards)
- Set 3: Into the Inklands (204 cards)
- Additional sets as released
- Card ability DSL/builder patterns
- Card definition tests

### Success Criteria
- All cards from target sets defined
- Complex card interactions working
- Card definitions type-safe
- Comprehensive ability coverage

---

## Phase 6: Advanced Features (Future)

### Scope
Implement specialized mechanics and edge cases.

### Deliverables
- Location cards and movement
- Shift mechanic
- Singer/Song mechanics
- Challenge damage resolution
- Complex timing interactions
- Edge case handling

### Success Criteria
- All official mechanics implemented
- Edge cases properly handled
- Rules verified against official rulings
- Comprehensive test coverage

---

## Phase 7: Optimization & Polish (Future)

### Scope
Performance optimization and production readiness.

### Deliverables

- Production-ready quality

---

## Future Considerations

### Potential Additions
- **AI Support:** Pre-built evaluation functions and move selection helpers
- **Simulation Tools:** Batch game simulation for card balancing
- **Rule Debugger:** Visual tool for understanding game state changes
- **Card DSL:** Higher-level language for defining card abilities
- **Performance Dashboard:** Real-time metrics for engine performance
- **Multiplayer Extensions:** Support for multiplayer formats beyond 2-player

### Community Contributions
- Card set contributions from community
- Custom format definitions
- Additional game modes
- Performance improvements
- Bug reports and edge cases
