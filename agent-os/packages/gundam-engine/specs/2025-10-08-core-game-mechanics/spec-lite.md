# Spec Summary (Lite)

Implement fundamental Gundam Card Game mechanics using `@tcg/core` framework to create a playable game engine supporting complete turn cycles, zone management, and core moves (resource play, unit deployment, pilot pairing, combat, turn end). The implementation establishes the foundation for a production-ready Gundam TCG engine with deterministic state management, proper phase flow (Start, Draw, Resource, Main, End), seven zone types, and complete game initialization including setup procedures.
