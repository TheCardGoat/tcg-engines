# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Gundam Card Game Engine Test Specification
> Created: 2025-10-09

## Overview

Create comprehensive end-to-end test specifications for the Gundam Card Game engine to ensure the implementation behaves according to the official comprehensive rules Ver. 1.0. This specification defines high-level test cases that validate game mechanics from board instantiation through action execution to state assertion, using the existing core engine as foundation.

## User Stories

### Game Designer

As a game designer, I want comprehensive test coverage of all Gundam Card Game rules, so that I can confidently validate that the engine implementation matches the official game mechanics and ensure no rules are misinterpreted or missing.

This includes validating turn structure, phase progression, card interactions, battle mechanics, effect resolution order, and all keyword effects. The tests should serve as both validation and documentation of how the game rules translate to code.

### Engine Developer

As an engine developer, I want clear end-to-end test specifications that follow a consistent pattern (setup → action → assertion), so that I can implement the game engine with confidence that each component behaves correctly in isolation and in combination with other systems.

The tests should validate immutability, determinism, and proper state transitions while being maintainable and easy to understand.

### AI Agent

As an AI agent implementing features, I want test specifications that clearly document expected behavior for every rule, so that I can implement new cards, effects, and mechanics with confidence that they integrate properly with the existing engine.

## Spec Scope

1. **Game Setup and Win Conditions** - Comprehensive tests for game initialization, deck validation, starting hands, shield placement, and all defeat conditions
2. **Card Locations and Zone Management** - Tests for all game locations (deck, hand, battle area, shield area, resource area, trash, removal), zone transitions, and zone capacity limits
3. **Turn Flow and Phase System** - Tests for complete turn progression through all phases (start, draw, resource, main, end) and their steps
4. **Resource Management** - Tests for resource placement, cost payment, level requirements, and resource limits
5. **Battle System** - Complete battle flow tests including attack declaration, block step, action steps, damage resolution, and battle end
6. **Card Deployment and Pairing** - Tests for Unit deployment, Base deployment, Pilot pairing, and Link Units
7. **Effect System** - Tests for all effect types (constant, triggered, activated, command, substitution) and their resolution order
8. **Keyword Effects** - Individual tests for each keyword effect (<Repair>, <Breach>, <Support>, <Blocker>, <First Strike>, <High-Maneuver>)
9. **Rules Management** - Tests for automatic rules management (defeat determination, destruction, area excess management)
10. **Edge Cases and Complex Interactions** - Tests for rule precedence, simultaneous effects, effect timing, and complex multi-card interactions

## Out of Scope

- UI/UX implementation and rendering
- Network synchronization and multiplayer lobbies
- Card art and visual assets
- Deck building interface
- AI opponent implementation
- Tournament and competitive play features
- Card collection management
- Tutorial system

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Complete Test Specification Document** - A comprehensive markdown document detailing all test cases organized by game system, with clear preconditions, actions, and expected outcomes
2. **Test Case Coverage Matrix** - A mapping of every rule section in the comprehensive rules to corresponding test cases
3. **Test Helper Utilities Specification** - Definition of reusable test utilities for common operations (e.g., `createTestGame`, `playUnit`, `declareAttack`)
4. **Integration with Core Engine** - All tests leverage the existing core engine's type system, move definitions, and state management
5. **Executable Test Suite** - Tests written in TypeScript using bun test that can be run to validate engine implementation
