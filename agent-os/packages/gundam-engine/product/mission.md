# Product Mission

## Overview

`@tcg/gundam` is a comprehensive implementation of the Gundam Card Game using the `@tcg/core` framework. This package serves a dual purpose:

1. **Reference Implementation**: Demonstrates best practices for building complex TCG engines with `@tcg/core`, validating the framework's extensibility and serving as a blueprint for implementing games with sophisticated mechanics like multi-phase combat, multi-zone card interactions, and intricate timing systems.
2. **Production Engine**: Provides a fully-featured, production-ready Gundam Card Game engine that can be integrated into multiplayer games, AI opponents, and simulation tools.

## Goals

### Primary Goals

1. **Validate Core Framework**: Serve as a comprehensive testing ground for `@tcg/core`, pushing the framework's capabilities with complex mechanics and identifying opportunities for refinement. Ensure the framework can handle:
   - Multi-zone card interactions (Hand, Deck, G-Zone, Junk Yard, Battle Area)
   - Complex combat systems with multiple attackers/blockers
   - G-order system and special card types
   - Intricate ability timing and priority windows
   - Resource generation and management systems

2. **Complete Rule Implementation**: Implement all official Gundam Card Game rules including:
   - Turn structure (Set, Draw, Deploy, Battle, End phases)
   - Card types (Units, Commands, G-Orders, Pilots)
   - Core mechanics (Deployment, Combat, Activation, G-orders)
   - Keyword abilities (Double Attack, Intercept, Shield, Burst, Counter, etc.)
   - Triggered and activated abilities
   - Zone management (Hand, Deck, G-Zone, Junk Yard, Battle Area)
   - Combat system with attacker/blocker declaration
   - Damage assignment and resolution

3. **Type-Safe Game Definition**: Create a declarative, type-safe game definition that:
   - Defines all Gundam-specific state shape
   - Registers all available moves
   - Configures turn/phase/step flow
   - Establishes zone configurations
   - Provides validation rules
   - Models combat state and resolution

4. **Comprehensive Card Library**: Build a complete card definition system for Gundam card sets, demonstrating how to express complex card abilities, G-orders, and multi-card interactions using the framework's DSL.

### Secondary Goals

1. **Documentation by Example**: Serve as living documentation showing developers how to:
   - Structure a complex TCG engine package
   - Define game-specific state types for intricate mechanics
   - Implement sophisticated move handlers
   - Create card definitions with complex abilities
   - Handle multi-step combat systems
   - Write behavior-driven tests for complex interactions
   - Integrate with the core framework

2. **Performance Benchmarking**: Establish performance baselines for complex TCG engines built with `@tcg/core`, identifying optimization opportunities for games with extensive state tracking.

3. **AI Integration Ready**: Structure the engine to support AI opponent development through clear move enumeration, combat evaluation, and state evaluation APIs.

## Success Criteria

- All official Gundam Card Game rules implemented and tested
- 100% test coverage of game mechanics through behavior tests
- Type-safe throughout with TypeScript strict mode
- Deterministic and replayable gameplay
- Clear integration patterns documented
- Serves as advanced template for other complex TCG implementations
- Performance suitable for real-time multiplayer gameplay
- Comprehensive combat system validation

## Non-Goals

- UI/UX implementation (this is a logic-only engine)
- Network/multiplayer infrastructure (handled by consumers)
- Asset management (card images, sounds, etc.)
- Deck building interface
- Player authentication or accounts
- Tournament management systems
- Official card rulings database (implemented as code, not data)

## Target Users

1. **Game Developers**: Building Gundam Card Game implementations for web, mobile, or desktop
2. **AI Researchers**: Training AI agents to play Gundam Card Game
3. **Rule Engine Developers**: Learning how to build complex TCG engines with `@tcg/core`
4. **Simulation Tools**: Requiring accurate Gundam Card Game logic for testing and analysis
5. **Framework Developers**: Using this as a stress test for `@tcg/core` capabilities
