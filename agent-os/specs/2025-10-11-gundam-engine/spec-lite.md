# Spec Summary (Lite)

Restructure the 1,145-line Gundam TCG RULES.md into a three-tier progressive disclosure system (INDEX.md → light.md summaries → full.md details) optimized for LLM consumption. Create KEYWORDS-INDEX.md for quick lookup of all keyword effects and keywords, convert all cross-references to markdown links, and organize content into logical folders by section. This reduces context bloat while maintaining complete rule accuracy and enabling efficient navigation to specific rules at appropriate detail levels.
