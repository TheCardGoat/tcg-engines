Passive Abilities for more information.</td></tr><tr><td>560.3.</td><td>Apply cost increases.</td></tr><tr><td>560.4.</td><td>Apply discounts in any order.</td></tr><tr><td>560.4.a.</td><td>Discounts may be applied by the card being played or by any other card or effect.</td></tr><tr><td>560.4.b.</td><td>Discounts may say that cards "cost [amount] less" or that one or more of their costs are "reduced by [amount]."</td></tr><tr><td>560.4.c.</td><td>If a discount applies a minimum cost, that minimum applies only to that discount.
Example: Eager Apprentice says "While I'm at a battlefield, the Energy costs for spells you play is reduced by [1], to a minimum of [1]." A player who controls Eager Apprentice and a unit with 7 Might plays Sky Splitter, a spell that costs 8 Energy and says "This spell's Energy cost is reduced by the highest Might among units you control." That player can choose to apply Eager Apprentice's discount first, reducing Sky Splitter's Energy cost to 7, then apply Sky Splitter's discount, reducing its Energy cost to 0. If they applied these discounts in the other order, Sky Splitter's Energy cost would be 1.</td></tr><tr><td>560.4.d.</td><td>Discounts can reduce additional costs, including to 0.</td></tr><tr><td>560.4.d.1.</td><td>An optional additional cost was "paid" if the player made the decision in rule 559 to pay it. It doesn't matter how much the player actually paid.
Example: Clockwork Keeper is a unit that costs 2 Energy and 0 Power and says "As you play me, you may pay [C] as an additional cost. If you do, draw " A player controls a card that says "Units you play cost [A] less." That player plays Clockwork Keeper and chooses to pay the optional additional cost of [C]. They will draw a card, even though the optional additional cost was reduced to 0.</td></tr><tr><td>560.5.</td><td>Energy and Power costs can't be reduced below 0.</td></tr><tr><td>560.6.</td><td>Costs may be Energy costs, Power costs, or non-standard costs.
Example: A card reads "As an additional cost to play me, kill a friendly unit." Killing a friendly unit is an additional cost to play that card.</td></tr><tr><td>561.</td><td>Pay the card's costs.</td></tr><tr><td>561.1.</td><td>In total, pay the combined Energy cost (if any) and Power cost (if any).</td></tr><tr><td>561.1.a.</td><td>During this step, the spell's controller can use activated abilities with the Reaction tag that Add resources to add Energy and Power to pay the spell's costs.
See rule 158. Rune Pools and rule 605. Add for more information.</td></tr><tr><td>561.2.</td><td>In addition, pay any non-standard Cost summed in rule 560.2 in any order.</td></tr><tr><td>561.3.</td><td>A player may not pay costs during this step that will deterministically result in illegal choices or actions later in this process unless they have no choice.
Example: A player plays Cruel Patron, which says "As an additional cost to play me, kill a friendly unit." They control multiple units, one of which is alone at a battlefield. During step b, they chose to play Cruel Patron to that battlefield. While paying costs, they can't choose to kill the unit at that battlefield, because then they will no longer control that battlefield and Cruel Patron cannot legally be played there. If they controlled that battlefield with multiple units, any of those units would be a legal choice, because they would still control the battlefield after killing one.</td></tr><tr><td>562.</td><td>Check legality.</td></tr><tr><td>562.1.</td><td>Check that all chosen targets are legal.</td></tr><tr><td>562.2.</td><td>Ensure that the outcome of the effect of this card being played would not create an illegal state.
Example: Check that a spell's execution does not create a state where a Battlefield has Units controlled by 3 different players.</td></tr><tr><td>562.3.</td><td>If the card, if continued to be played, would create an illegal state, or if a choice or action at this state is illegal, the actions taken in this process are undone and the action is cancelled.</td></tr><tr><td>563.</td><td>Proceed with the card's category of Play.</td></tr><tr><td>563.1.</td><td>A Permanent leaves the Chain and becomes a Game Object.</td></tr><tr><td>563.1.a.</td><td>Any static rules text becomes active.</td></tr><tr><td>563.1.b.</td><td>Execute all rules text on the card, from top to bottom.</td></tr><tr><td>563.1.c.</td><td>If it is a Unit, it enters the Board exhausted at the Location that was chosen.</td></tr><tr><td>563.1.d.</td><td>If it is a Gear, it enters the Board Ready at the player's Base.</td></tr><tr><td>563.2.</td><td>A Spell lingers on the Chain.</td></tr><tr><td>563.2.a.</td><td>Other players have an opportunity to play Reactions before the resolution of spells.
See rule 532. Chains for more information.</td></tr><tr><td>563.2.b.</td><td>Otherwise, execute the game effect of the spell, from top to bottom of the rules text of the card and then place the card in the Trash of the owning player.</td></tr><tr><td>563.2.c.</td><td>Handling illegal and impossible instructions</td></tr><tr><td>563.2.c.1.</td><td>The spell resolves even if some or all of its targets are illegal.</td></tr><tr><td>563.2.c.2.</td><td>A target is illegal as the spell resolves if it no longer meets the targeting requirements of the spell, or if it has changed Zones to or from a Non-Board Zone.</td></tr><tr><td>563.2.c.3.</td><td>If a target ceases to meet the targeting requirements while the spell is on the chain, then meets them again, it's a legal target.
Example: A spell targets "a unit at a battlefield." A player reacts with a spell that moves the unit to base, then another player reacts with a spell that moves it back to that battlefield, then the original spell resolves. The unit is a legal target.</td></tr><tr><td>563.2.c.4.</td><td>If a target changes Zones to or from a Non-Board Zone and then returns to its original zone, it is no longer a legal target, because it's not treated as the same object.
Examples:
An enemy unit at a battlefield is no longer a legal target if it is no longer an enemy, no longer a unit, or no longer at a battlefield.
A unit with 3 or less Might is no longer a legal target if it is no longer a unit or if its Might is greater than 3.
Something that's exhausted is no longer a legal target if it is no longer exhausted. (It can't stop being "something.")</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>A spell that's played from hidden has the additional targeting requirement "here." A target for such a spell ceases to be a legal target if it moves from the battlefield where that spell was played, even if the spell has no location targeting requirement otherwise.</td></tr><tr><td>563.2.c.5.</td><td>If any of the spell's targets are no longer legal, those targets are unaffected by the spell as it resolves.
Example: A player plays Void Seeker, a spell that says "Deal 4 to a unit at a battlefield. Draw " The unit's controller uses a Reaction to move the unit to their base. Since the unit is no longer a legal target, it is not dealt any damage. Void Seeker's controller still draws 1.</td></tr><tr><td>563.2.c.6.</td><td>Instructions that can't be followed, either because of illegal targets or other circumstances, are ignored.</td></tr><tr><td>563.2.c.7.</td><td>Instructions that can be partially followed are followed as much as possible and ignored otherwise.
Example: A player plays a spell that says "Discard 2, then draw 2" If their hand is empty, the instruction to discard 2 will be ignored.
They'll still draw 2. If they had 1 card in hand, they would discard it and draw 2.</td></tr><tr><td>563.2.c.8.</td><td>If the spell checks information about a target that is no longer legal or a card or permanent whose location, zone, or status has changed such that that information is no longer available, that check returns "zero" or "null" as appropriate.
Example: A unit that is no longer on the board is treated as having 0 Might, 0 cost, etc.
Example: A unit that is no longer on the board has no location, is neither exhausted nor readied, etc.
Example: Last Breath says "Ready a friendly unit. It deals damage equal to its Might to an enemy unit at a battlefield." While Last Breath is on the chain, an opponent reacts with a spell that returns the friendly unit to its owner's hand. Because the friendly unit is no longer a legal target, it can't be readied and its Might is treated as 0.
Last Breath readies nothing and deals 0 damage to the chosen enemy unit.</td></tr><tr><td>563.2.c.9.</td><td>A spell or ability that moves something to a different zone as a cost or effect can "look back" at its characteristics before it changes zones.</td></tr><tr><td>564.</td><td>Abilities</td></tr><tr><td>565.</td><td>An Ability is the structured rules and capabilities of Game Objects or Spells.</td></tr><tr><td>565.1.</td><td>An Ability has multiple structures.
Passive Abilities
Replacement Effects
Activated Abilities
Triggered Abilities</td></tr><tr><td>566.</td><td>A card can have more than one Ability and more than one type of Ability.</td></tr><tr><td>567.</td><td>Passive Abilities</td></tr><tr><td>568.</td><td>Conditions, rules, constraints, or statements that affect the course of regular play.</td></tr><tr><td>568.1.</td><td>These abilities have a wide variety of formats to recognize.
Example: "I get +1[S] while you have 2 or more cards in your hand."
Example: "Friendly Yordles at my battlefield have [Shield]."</td></tr><tr><td>568.2.</td><td>They can be recognized by being statements of fact.</td></tr><tr><td>568.3.</td><td>Passive Abilities can be conditional.</td></tr><tr><td>568.3.a.</td><td>Conditional Passive Abilities can be recognized by the occurrence of "if" or "while" as part of the statement of the ability.
Example: "While I'm attacking or defending alone, I have +2 [S]." 
Example: "If an opponent controls a battlefield, I enter ready."</td></tr><tr><td>569.</td><td>Presence on Permanents</td></tr><tr><td>569.1.</td><td>Passive Abilities of Permanents are typically only active while on the Board.</td></tr><tr><td>570.</td><td>Presence on Card outside of the Board</td></tr><tr><td>570.1.</td><td>Passive Abilities of cards in zones that are outside of the Board will self-describe their context.
Example: The passive ability "Play me only during an opponent's turn." applies in any zone from which that card can be played.</td></tr><tr><td>570.2.</td><td>Passive Abilities can alter the costs of cards as they are played.</td></tr><tr><td>570.2.a.</td><td>These apply at all times in any zone from which the card with the ability can be played.</td></tr><tr><td>571.</td><td>Replacement Effects</td></tr><tr><td>572.</td><td>An ability that alters the application of another game effect or game rule.</td></tr><tr><td>572.1.</td><td>Passive Abilities can be Replacement Effects.</td></tr><tr><td>572.2.</td><td>Triggered Abilities can be Replacement Effects.</td></tr><tr><td>573.</td><td>Replacement Effects intercede during the execution of a Game Effect and alter its execution.</td></tr><tr><td>573.1.</td><td>A Replacement Effect can be identified by the presence of the term "instead."
Example: Zhonya's Hourglass reads "The next time a friendly unit would die, kill this instead. Recall that unit exhausted." This is a replacement effect that alters the execution of any Game Effect that would kill a friendly unit.</td></tr><tr><td>574.</td><td>A Replacement Effect can alter the typical flow of play, including other cards' executions.</td></tr><tr><td>575.</td><td>If more than one Replacement Effect applies to the same event being executed, then the owner of the object being acted on determines the order the Replacement Effects will apply.</td></tr><tr><td>575.1.</td><td>If it is a player being acted on, that player decides the order the Replacement Effects will apply.</td></tr><tr><td>575.2.</td><td>If the affected object is an Uncontrolled Battlefield then the Current Turn Player decides the order the Replacement Effects will apply.</td></tr><tr><td>576.</td><td>Activated Abilities</td></tr><tr><td>577.</td><td>Activated Abilities are repeatable effects with a cost.
