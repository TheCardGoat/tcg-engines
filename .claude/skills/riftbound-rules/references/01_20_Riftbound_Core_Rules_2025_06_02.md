<table><tr><td>000.</td><td>Golden and Silver Rules</td></tr><tr><td>001.</td><td>Golden Rule</td></tr><tr><td>002.</td><td>Card text supersedes rules text. Whenever a card fundamentally contradicts the rules, the card's indication is what is true.</td></tr><tr><td>050.</td><td>Silver Rule</td></tr><tr><td>051.</td><td>Card text uses different terminology than rules. Card text should be interpreted according to these rules, not as though it were text within these rules.</td></tr><tr><td>052.</td><td>Card, when written in card effects, is shorthand for "Main Deck card." Runes, legends, and battlefields are not considered cards when executing the abilities and effects of game objects. They are considered cards for the purposes of these rules.</td></tr><tr><td>053.</td><td>Cards refer to themselves in the first person.</td></tr><tr><td>053.1.</td><td>Units and legends say "I," "me," etc.</td></tr><tr><td>053.2.</td><td>Gear and spells say "this."</td></tr><tr><td>053.3.</td><td>Battlefields say "here."</td></tr><tr><td>100.</td><td>Game Concepts</td></tr><tr><td>101.</td><td>Deck Construction</td></tr><tr><td>102.</td><td>Riftbound is a Trading Card Game where a player must provide their own cards to play against other players.</td></tr><tr><td>103.</td><td>To play Riftbound, a player must have two Decks, a Champion Legend, and a number of Battlefields determined by the Mode of Play.</td></tr><tr><td>103.1.</td><td>1 Champion Legend</td></tr><tr><td>103.1.a.</td><td>This is placed in the Legend Zone at the start of the game.</td></tr><tr><td>103.1.b.</td><td>This will dictate the Domain Identity of the Main Deck.</td></tr><tr><td>103.1.b.1.</td><td>Cards included in your Deck must abide by your Domain Identity.</td></tr><tr><td>103.1.b.2.</td><td>This can be Domain, Type, Tag, or any other attribute.</td></tr><tr><td>103.1.b.3.</td><td>If a card has a single Domain, then that card is permitted in the Domain Identity that corresponds to the same Domain.</td></tr><tr><td>103.1.b.4.</td><td>If a card has more than one Domain, then that card is permitted only in a Domain Identity that contains all of the indicated Domains on that card.</td></tr><tr><td>103.2.</td><td>A Main Deck of at least 40 cards
