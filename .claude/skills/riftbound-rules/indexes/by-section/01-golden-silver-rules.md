## Overview
This section establishes the fundamental principles that govern how rules and card text interact in Riftbound.

---

## 000-002: Golden Rule

### Summary
Card text supersedes rules text. Whenever a card fundamentally contradicts the rules, the card's indication is what is true.

### Key Points:
- If a card says something different from the rules, follow the card
- This applies to all card types (units, spells, gear, etc.)
- The card's specific instruction takes precedence

### Example:
If a rule says "Units enter exhausted" but a card says "I enter ready," the card wins.

## 050-053: Silver Rule

### Summary
Card text uses different terminology than rules text. Card text should be interpreted according to these rules, not as though it were text within these rules.

### Key Terminology Differences:

#### Rule 052: "Card" Definition
- **On cards:** "Card" is shorthand for "Main Deck card"
- **Exclusions:** Runes, legends, and battlefields are NOT considered "cards" when executing abilities and effects
- **In rules:** Runes, legends, and battlefields ARE considered cards for rules purposes

#### Rule 053: Self-Reference
Cards refer to themselves in the first person:

| Card Type | Self-Reference |
|-----------|----------------|
| Units | "I," "me," etc. |
| Legends | "I," "me," etc. |
| Gear | "this" |
| Spells | "this" |
| Battlefields | "here" |

### Examples:
- A unit ability saying "When I attack..." refers to that specific unit
- A spell saying "Deal 3 damage to a unit. This deals 1 additional damage if..." refers to the spell itself
- A battlefield saying "Units here have +1 Might" refers to units at that battlefield

## Why These Rules Matter

### Golden Rule Applications:
- Resolving apparent contradictions between cards and rules
- Understanding that cards can create exceptions to normal gameplay
- Knowing when to follow card text over general rules

### Silver Rule Applications:
- Correctly interpreting card text
- Understanding scope of effects (what counts as a "card")
- Parsing self-referential abilities correctly
