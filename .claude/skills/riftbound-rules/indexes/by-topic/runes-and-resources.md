## The Rune Pool

**Rule refs:** 158-161

### What It Is
- Conceptual collection of available Energy and Power
- No physical tracker required (but can use one)

### How It Works
1. **Add** resources to pool (from rune abilities, card effects)
2. **Spend** resources from pool to pay costs
3. Pool **empties** at specific times

### When Pool Empties (160)
- End of each player's **Draw Phase**
- End of each player's **turn** (Expiration Step)

**Important:** Unspent resources are **lost** when pool empties!

### What It Is
- Taking runes from top of Rune Deck
- Putting them on the Board

### When You Channel
- **Channel Phase:** Channel 2 runes (automatic)

### Channel Phase Rules
- Channel 2 runes from Rune Deck
- If fewer than 2 available, channel as many as possible
- Runes enter **ready** (unless effect says otherwise)

## Paying Costs

**Rule refs:** 130, 560-561

### Card Costs

2. Add resources to Rune Pool (tap runes, use abilities)
3. Spend from Rune Pool to pay

## Resource Math Example

**Card Cost:** 3 Energy + 1 Fury Power + 1 Mind Power

**Your Runes:**
- 2 Fury Runes (ready)
- 1 Mind Rune (ready)
- 1 Calm Rune (ready)

**Payment:**
1. Tap Fury Rune 1: Add [1] → Pool: 1 Energy
2. Tap Fury Rune 2: Add [1] → Pool: 2 Energy
3. Tap Mind Rune: Add [1] → Pool: 3 Energy
4. Recycle Calm Rune: Add [G] → Pool: 3 Energy, 1 Calm Power

**Problem:** You have Calm Power but need Fury Power!

**Solution:** Recycle a Fury Rune instead:
1. Tap Fury Rune 1: Add [1] → Pool: 1 Energy
2. Tap Mind Rune: Add [1] → Pool: 2 Energy
3. Tap Calm Rune: Add [1] → Pool: 3 Energy
4. Recycle Fury Rune 2: Add [R] → Pool: 3 Energy, 1 Fury Power
5. Recycle Mind Rune... wait, it's tapped!

**Better Solution:** Plan ahead!
1. Recycle Fury Rune 1: Add [R] → Pool: 1 Fury Power
2. Tap Fury Rune 2: Add [1] → Pool: 1 Energy, 1 Fury Power
3. Recycle Mind Rune: Add [U] → Pool: 1 Energy, 1 Fury, 1 Mind Power
4. Tap Calm Rune: Add [1] → Pool: 2 Energy, 1 Fury, 1 Mind Power
5. Need 1 more Energy... Channel Phase gave you more runes!
