**Rule refs:** 620-621

1. A Cleanup occurs
2. No items on the Chain
3. A Battlefield has Units from **two opposing players**

### Pending Combat
- Combat is "Pending" when conditions are met but steps haven't started
- Turn Player chooses which Pending Combat to resolve first
- If conditions change before steps begin, Combat doesn't happen

### Two-Player Limit
- Combat is ALWAYS between exactly **two players**
- Third player cannot join an ongoing Combat
- Battlefields with Pending/In-Progress Combat are invalid destinations for others

---

## When Showdowns Occur

**Rule refs:** 545-548

### With Combat
- Showdown opens as first step of Combat
- Attacker and Defender are Relevant Players

### Without Combat
- When Units move to an **uncontrolled** Battlefield
- All players are Relevant Players
- No Combat damage occurs

---

## Steps of Combat

### Step 1: Showdown Step
**Rule refs:** 625

1. **Establish Roles**
   - **Attacker** = Player who applied Contested status
   - **Defender** = Other player

2. **Apply Combat Modifiers**
   - Attacking Units with **Assault** get +X Might
   - Defending Units with **Shield** get +X Might

3. **Initial Chain** (if applicable)
   - "When I attack" triggers
   - "When I defend" triggers
   - Player with Focus orders first

4. **Showdown Window**
   - Players can play Action/Reaction cards
   - Focus passes between Relevant Players
   - Ends when all pass in sequence

### Step 2: Combat Damage Step
**Rule refs:** 626

**Only occurs if both Attacking AND Defending Units remain**

1. **Sum Might** for each side
2. **Distribute Damage** (Attacker first, then Defender)

#### Damage Assignment Rules:
- Units with **Tank** must receive lethal damage first
- Must assign **lethal damage** to a Unit before moving to next
- **Lethal damage** = damage ≥ Unit's Might

**Example:**
> 5 damage to distribute among 3-Might, 3-Might, 2-Might units:
> - Assign 3 to first unit (lethal) ✓
> - Assign 2 to second unit (not lethal, but all remaining)
> - Cannot split 2-1-1-1 (must assign lethal before moving on)

### Step 3: Resolution Step
**Rule refs:** 627

1. **Kill Units** with damage ≥ Might
2. **Determine Outcome:**

| Remaining Units | Result |
|-----------------|--------|
| Both sides | Attackers **Recalled** to Base |
| Only Attackers | Battlefield **Conquered** |
| Only Defenders | Defenders keep control |
| Neither | No control change |

3. **Clear Contested status**
4. **Clear all damage** from all Units at all Locations

### Step 4: Cleanup
Perform standard Cleanup after Combat.

## Showdown Rules

**Rule refs:** 545-553

### What is a Showdown?
- Window of Opportunity for Relevant Players
- Open State where players can play cards alternately
- Each card played creates a Chain

### Relevant Players
| Situation | Who is Relevant |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Combat | Attacker and Defender |
| Non-Combat Showdown | All players |
| Invited | Players who accept invitation |

### Focus
- Player who applied Contested status gets Focus first
- Focus passes when Chain resolves
- Player with Focus can:
  - Play Action/Reaction spell
  - Activate Action/Reaction ability
  - Invite another player
  - Pass

### Ending a Showdown
- All Relevant Players pass in sequence
- Then Combat Damage Step (if Combat) or Cleanup (if not)

## Battlefield Control

**Rule refs:** 179-181

### Control States
- **Controlled** - A player has Units there (outside Combat)
- **Uncontrolled** - No player has Units there
- **Contested** - Opposing Units just arrived

### How Control Changes
1. Player moves Units to Battlefield
2. Battlefield becomes Contested
3. Combat occurs (if defender has Units)
4. After Combat, whoever has remaining Units controls it

### Control Rules
- Maintained while Contested by opponent
- Changes immediately after Combat if different player's Units remain
- Lost if you have no Units there

## Scoring

**Rule refs:** 629-633

### Two Ways to Score

#### Conquer (630.1)

- Must not have scored that Battlefield this turn
- In team modes: Can't score Battlefields teammate controlled at Beginning Phase

#### Hold (630.2)
- Control a Battlefield during your Beginning Phase
- Automatic scoring during Scoring Step

### Scoring Limit
- Maximum **once per Battlefield per turn** (either method)

### Points
- Each Score earns **1 point** (with Final Point restrictions)

### Final Point Rules
When 1 point from Victory Score:
- **Hold:** Score the Final Point ✓
- **Conquer ALL Battlefields this turn:** Score the Final Point ✓
- **Conquer but not all:** Draw a card instead

### Victory Scores
