## Golden and Silver Rules Quick Reference

These principles override other rules:

### Golden Rule (001-002)
**Card text beats rules** - If a card contradicts a game rule, the card wins

### Silver Rule (050-053)
**Terminology differs** - Card text uses different terminology than rules:
- "Card" on cards = Main Deck card only
- Units/legends say "I," "me"
- Gear/spells say "this"
- Battlefields say "here"
