## Deck Building Tips

### Choose Your Ink Types
- Pick 1-2 ink types that synergize with your strategy
- Consider which cards you want to play
- Mono-color = more consistent but limited card pool
- Dual-color = more options but less consistent

### Card Ratios
- Run 4 copies of key cards (maximum consistency)
- 3 copies of important but not essential cards
- 2 copies of situational cards
- 1 copy of silver bullet / tech cards

### Inkwell Symbols
- Include enough cards with inkwell symbols (⬡)
- Typically 30-40+ cards with inkwell symbols
- Ensures you can play your expensive cards

### Lore Generation
- Balance between questing characters and utility
- Need lore to win (goal is 20 lore)
- Don't forget lore-generating locations

### Testing and Tuning
- Test your deck
- Adjust based on what works and what doesn't
- Consider the metagame (what others are playing)
