## All Keywords Alphabetically

### Bodyguard
**Effect:** Opponents must challenge this character first (while it's ready)
**Reminder:** "While you have a character with Bodyguard, opponents can't challenge your other characters."
**Rule ref:** 10.2
**Stacks:** No

**How it Works:**
- While you have a ready Bodyguard character, opponents must challenge it
- Opponents can't challenge your other characters
- Only works while Bodyguard character is ready (not exerted)

**Counters:** Evasive ignores Bodyguard

**Common Use:** Protect valuable characters

---

### Challenger
**Effect:** Get +X Strength while challenging
**Reminder:** "This character gets +X Strength while challenging."
**Rule ref:** 10.3
**Stacks:** Yes (add together)

**How it Works:**
- Adds to Strength during challenge damage step
- Only when YOU are the challenger (not when being challenged)
- Increases damage dealt

**Example:** 3 Strength with Challenger +2 = deals 5 damage while challenging

**Common Use:** Aggressive characters that deal extra damage on offense

---

### Evasive
**Effect:** Can challenge ready characters and ignores Bodyguard
**Reminder:** "This character can challenge ready characters and ignores Bodyguard."
**Rule ref:** 10.4
**Stacks:** No (one instance is enough)

**How it Works:**
- Can challenge ready characters (normally can only challenge exerted)
- Completely ignores Bodyguard
- Bypasses defensive setups

**Common Use:** Aggressive characters that bypass normal challenge restrictions

**Very Powerful:** Offense-oriented keyword

---

### Reckless
**Effect:** This character can't quest
**Reminder:** "This character can't quest."
**Rule ref:** 10.5
**Stacks:** No

**How it Works:**
- Cannot quest (can't gain lore by questing)
- Can still challenge and use abilities
- Usually on high-Strength aggressive characters

**Trade-off:** Can't quest, but usually has good combat stats

**Common Use:** Pure combat characters

---

### Resist
**Effect:** Take X less damage from all sources
**Reminder:** "This character takes X less damage."
**Rule ref:** 10.6
**Stacks:** Yes (add together)

**How it Works:**
- Reduces damage dealt (not put)
- Applies to all damage sources (challenges, abilities)
- Reduces damage before placing counters

**Example:** Resist +2, takes 5 damage → only 3 damage counters placed

**Important:** Only affects "dealt" damage, not "put damage counters"

**Common Use:** Defensive characters, tanks

---

### Rush
**Effect:** Can quest, challenge, and use abilities the turn played
**Reminder:** "This character can quest, challenge, or use abilities the turn they're played."
**Rule ref:** 10.7
**Stacks:** No

**How it Works:**
- Bypasses the "dry" requirement
- Can act immediately when played
- Can quest, challenge, or use ⬇ abilities right away

**Common Use:** Immediate impact characters

**Like:** "Haste" in other card games

---

### Shift
**Effect:** Play this on top of another character for an alternate cost
**Reminder:** "You may play this character on top of a character named [X] for [cost] ink."
**Rule ref:** 10.8
**Stacks:** No

**How it Works:**
- Alternate way to play the character
- Choose a character in play with matching name
- Shift cost must be ≤ chosen character's cost
- Pay Shift cost instead of ink cost
- Place on top of chosen character (creates a stack)
- Shifted character is ready (even if underneath was exerted)
- Damage carries over from underneath character

**Example:** "Shift 4" = can play for 4 ink if placed on top of matching character

**Benefits:**
- Usually cheaper than normal cost
- New character is ready
- Keeps any damage (can be good or bad)

**Common Use:** Upgrading characters, maintaining board presence

---

### Singer
**Effect:** Can exert to sing songs for you
**Reminder:** "This character counts as cost [X] to sing songs."
**Rule ref:** 10.9
**Stacks:** No (one Singer is enough)

**How it Works:**
- Alternate way to play songs (Action - Song cards)
- Exert this Singer character instead of paying ink
- Song must have ink cost ≤ Singer's cost
- Character must be dry to sing

**Example:** Singer 5 can sing songs with cost 5 or less

**How to Sing:**
1. Announce you're playing the song
2. Exert a Singer with cost ≥ song's cost
3. Song effect resolves
4. Song goes to discard

**Common Use:** Playing expensive songs without using ink

---

### Sing Together
**Effect:** Multiple characters can sing a song together
**Reminder:** "This character counts as cost [X] when singing songs with other characters."
**Rule ref:** 10.10
**Stacks:** No

**How it Works:**
- Exert two or more characters to sing together
- Combined cost must be ≥ song's cost
- All must be dry
- Alternate cost for songs

**Example:** Sing Together 2 + Sing Together 3 = can sing a 5-cost song

**Common Use:** Playing expensive songs with multiple characters

---

### Support
**Effect:** When played, give another character +1 Strength this turn
**Reminder:** "When you play this character, you may choose one of your other characters. That character gets +1 Strength this turn."
**Rule ref:** 10.11
**Stacks:** Multiple characters with Support can each give +1

**How it Works:**
- When this character enters play, trigger
- Choose one of your other characters
- That character gets +1 Strength
- Lasts until end of turn

**Temporary:** Ends at end of turn

**Common Use:** Buffing attackers before challenges

---

### Vanish
**Effect:** If this would go to any zone other than play, banish it instead
**Reminder:** "If this card would go to any zone other than play, banish it instead."
**Rule ref:** 10.12
**Stacks:** No

**How it Works:**

- Still affected by "all" or "each" effects
- Can still be challenged

**What Ward Prevents:**
- "Choose a character and banish it"
- "Choose a character. It gets -2 Strength"
- Any effect requiring opponent to "choose" this card

**What Ward Doesn't Prevent:**

- "Each character gets -1 Strength"
- Challenges (can still be challenged normally)
- Your own effects

**Common Use:** Protecting key characters from removal
