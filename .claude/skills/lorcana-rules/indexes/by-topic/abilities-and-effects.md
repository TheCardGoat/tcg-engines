## Types of Abilities

4. That ability resolves completely
5. Game state check occurs
6. If bag has more abilities, repeat from step 3
7. Once bag is empty, game continues

**Important:**
- Only triggered abilities use the bag
- Activated abilities don't use the bag
- Static abilities don't use the bag
- Action card effects don't use the bag (resolve immediately)
