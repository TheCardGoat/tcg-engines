## Golden Rules Quick Reference

These four principles override other rules (Rule 1.2):

1. **Card text beats rules** - If a card contradicts a game rule, the card wins
2. **Prohibition beats permission** - Effects that prevent something override effects that allow it
3. **Do as much as you can** - Resolve as much of an effect as possible even if some parts can't be done
4. **Choices during resolution** - Choices for effects are made during resolution, not when playing the card

---

## Common Mechanics

### The Bag (Rule 1.7)
- Triggered abilities wait in "the bag" before resolving
- Active player chooses which ability from the bag to resolve next
- Each ability resolves one at a time

### Game State Check (Rule 1.9)
Happens after every action/ability resolves:
- Check win conditions (20+ lore wins)
- Check loss conditions (tried to draw from empty deck)
- Check damage (characters/locations with damage ≥ willpower are banished)
- Then triggered abilities from these events go into the bag

### Multiplayer (Rule 1.10)
- Turn order proceeds to the left
- Active player acts first for simultaneous effects
- When a player loses, all their cards/effects leave the game
