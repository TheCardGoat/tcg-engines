## Important Concepts

### "Dry" Characters
- Characters are "drying" the turn they're played
- In the Set step of your next Beginning Phase, they're no longer drying (become "dry")
- Dry characters can quest, challenge, and use exert abilities
- This is similar to "summoning sickness" in other TCGs

### Turn Action Order
- Active player chooses the order
- Can take actions multiple times (except inkwell, which is once per turn)
- Must have resources to perform the action

### Challenge Damage Step
- Both characters deal damage simultaneously
- Not an ability or effect (doesn't use the bag)
- Damage equals each character's Strength
- Apply Strength modifiers first, then damage modifiers (like Resist)
- Game state check happens after damage is dealt
