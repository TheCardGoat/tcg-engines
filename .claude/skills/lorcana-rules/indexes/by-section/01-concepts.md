## Overview
This section covers fundamental game concepts that apply throughout gameplay, including the golden rules, player roles, ability types, the bag system, and game state checks.

---

## 1.1. General
**Summary:** Basic information about official card text, languages, tracking methods, and reminder text
**Key terms:** official version, card text updates, lore tracking, damage tracking, reminder text, italics
**Rule refs:** 1.1.1-1.1.6

---

## 1.2. Golden Rules
**Summary:** Four fundamental principles that override other rules when conflicts occur
**Key terms:** card text overrides rules, prohibition beats permission, do as much as you can, choices during resolution
**Rule refs:** 1.2.1-1.2.4

### The Four Golden Rules:
1. **Card text supersedes rules** - If card text contradicts a game rule, the card effect wins
2. **Prohibition beats permission** - Effects that prevent actions override effects that allow them
3. **Do as much as you can** - Resolve as much of an effect as possible even if parts can't be done
4. **Choices during resolution** - Choices are made as effects resolve, not when cards are played

**Example:** A card that says "This character can challenge ready characters" overrides the normal rule that you can only challenge exerted characters.

---

## 1.3. Active Player
**Summary:** Definition of the active player and when that status applies
**Key terms:** active player, turn start, turn end
**Rule refs:** 1.3.1

**Details:** When a player starts their turn, they become the active player. When their turn ends, they're no longer the active player.

---

## 1.4. Opponent
**Summary:** Definition of opponents and teammates
**Key terms:** opponent, teammates, multiplayer
**Rule refs:** 1.4.1-1.4.2

**Details:** Anyone a player is playing against is their opponent. Teammates (in team formats) are not opponents to each other.

---

## 1.5. Playing Cards
**Summary:** Requirements and process for playing cards from hand
**Key terms:** playing cards, reveal from hand, pay cost, active player
**Rule refs:** 1.5.1

**Details:** Players can play cards when they're the active player and no effects are resolving. To play a card, reveal it from hand and pay its cost.

---

## 1.6. Types of Abilities
**Summary:** The different kinds of abilities in Lorcana and how they function
**Key terms:** keywords, triggered abilities, activated abilities, static abilities, replacement effects
**Rule refs:** 1.6.1-1.6.2

### Ability Types:
- **Keywords** - Shortened phrases representing larger abilities (see Section 10)
- **Triggered abilities** - Automatically trigger when a condition is met (Section 7.4)
- **Activated abilities** - Require paying a cost to use (Section 7.5)
- **Static abilities** - Continuously active effects (Section 7.6)
- **Replacement effects** - Replace one effect with another (Section 7.7)

**Multi-player note:** When effects affect multiple players simultaneously, the active player resolves first, then others in turn order.

---

## 1.7. The Bag
**Summary:** The conceptual zone where triggered abilities wait to resolve
**Key terms:** the bag, triggered abilities, resolve, priority, active player chooses
**Rule refs:** 1.7.1-1.7.2

**Details:**
- The bag is not a physical zone, but a way to visualize triggered ability resolution
- Think of each triggered ability as a "marble" in a bag
- The active player chooses which ability from the bag to resolve next
- Each ability resolves completely before the next one is chosen
- See Section 8.7 for detailed bag resolution rules

---

## 1.8. Players' Cards
**Summary:** Ownership of cards and how card text references players
**Key terms:** player's cards, you/your/yours, his/her/its/their, card owner
**Rule refs:** 1.8.1-1.8.3

**Details:**
- Cards in a player's deck are their cards throughout the game
- "You/your/yours" on a card refers to the player who played that card
- "His/her/its/their" refers to the player who played the card or their turn

---

## 1.9. Game State Check
**Summary:** The automatic system that checks win/loss conditions and damage after every action
**Key terms:** game state check, required actions, game state conditions, 20 lore, empty deck, damage equals willpower, banished
**Rule refs:** 1.9.1-1.9.5

### Game State Conditions and Required Actions:

1. **20+ lore** → That player wins the game
2. **Draw from empty deck** → That player loses the game
3. **Damage ≥ Willpower** → Character/location is banished

**Timing:** Game state check occurs:
- At the end of every step
- After any action or ability finishes resolving
- After each effect in the bag finishes resolving

**Process:**
1. Check and complete all win/loss conditions first
2. Check and complete all other required actions
3. Repeat until no more required actions
4. Add any triggered abilities from this process to the bag

**Important:** Required actions happen in turn order. If a player would win and lose simultaneously, they win.

---

## 1.10. Multiplayer Games
**Summary:** Special rules that apply when playing with 3+ players
**Key terms:** multiplayer, three or more players, turn order left, simultaneous turns, teammates
**Rule refs:** 1.10.1-1.10.3

**Key Differences from 2-Player:**
- Turn order proceeds to the left
- When multiple players act simultaneously, active player goes first, then proceed left
- If a player loses by drawing from empty deck, they immediately leave and all their cards/effects are removed
- Some formats use simultaneous team turns where teammates progress through phases together
