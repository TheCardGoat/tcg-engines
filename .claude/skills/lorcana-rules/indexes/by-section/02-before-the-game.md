- **Infinity Constructed** - All sets legal, but has its own banned list
- **Limited** - Build decks from sealed product on the spot
- **Special Formats** - May have unique requirements

See official Disney Lorcana Tournament Rules and Fabled release notes for set rotation information.

### Full Name Definition
The "full name" of a card includes both parts:
- Character name (e.g., "Elsa")

Different versions of the same character have different full names and count as different cards for the 4-copy limit.
