## 3.1. Starting a Game
**Summary:** Step-by-step process to begin a game of Disney Lorcana
**Key terms:** starting player, randomize, shuffle, track lore, draw 7, alter hand, mulligan
**Rule refs:** 3.1.1-3.1.8

### Game Start Procedure:

#### Step 1: Determine Starting Player
**Rule ref:** 3.1.2
- Use random method (dice, coin flip, etc.) to determine who chooses the starting player
- **Exception:** In best-of-series, losing player of previous game chooses starting player

#### Step 2: Randomize Decks
**Rule ref:** 3.1.3
- Each player shuffles their deck sufficiently
- Each player must offer opponent opportunity to cut their deck
- Deck is then placed in the play area

#### Step 3: Track Lore
**Rule ref:** 3.1.4
- Each player begins at 0 lore
- Use any method: pen and paper, lore trackers, or official Companion app

#### Step 4: Draw Starting Hands
**Rule ref:** 3.1.5
- Each player draws 7 cards

#### Step 5: Alter Hands (Mulligan)
**Rule refs:** 3.1.6-3.1.6.5

Players may alter their hands once per game, following these steps:

1. **Selection** - Choose any number of cards to place on bottom of deck (don't reveal)
2. **Draw** - Draw until you have 7 cards again
3. **Turn Order** - In turn order, each other player completes steps 1-2 if they choose
4. **Shuffle** - Each player who altered their hand by 1+ cards shuffles their deck
5. **Cut** - Each player who altered offers opponent chance to cut

**Important:** Starting player alters hand first, then others in turn order

#### Step 6: Begin First Turn
**Rule ref:** 3.1.7
- Once all players have altered or declined to alter, game starts with starting player's Beginning Phase

## 3.2. Ending a Game
**Summary:** The three ways a game can end and how victory is determined
**Key terms:** 20 lore wins, empty deck loses, last player wins, multiplayer
**Rule refs:** 3.2.1-3.2.1.3

### Win/Loss Conditions:

#### Condition 1: Reach 20 Lore
**Rule ref:** 3.2.1.1
- When a player reaches 20 or more lore, they win immediately
- Checked during game state check (see Section 1.9)

#### Condition 2: Draw from Empty Deck
**Rule ref:** 3.2.1.2
- If a player attempts to draw from an empty deck, they lose the game
- All of that player's cards and effects are immediately removed
- **Multiplayer:** Game continues with remaining players
- If it was the losing player's turn, game progresses to next player's turn

**Important:** Only attempting to draw matters - having an empty deck alone doesn't cause a loss

#### Condition 3: Last Player Standing
**Rule ref:** 3.2.1.3
- If a player is the last person remaining in the game, they win
- Most relevant in multiplayer games
