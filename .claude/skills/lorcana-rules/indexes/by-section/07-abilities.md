3. Active player chooses which ability from the bag to resolve next
4. Ability resolves completely
5. Repeat until bag is empty

### Types of Triggered Abilities:

**Standard Triggered** - Trigger and go into the bag immediately
- Examples: "When this character is played...", "Whenever you play an action..."

**Two Trigger Conditions** (7.4.x) - Some abilities have two conditions
- Must meet both or just one depending on wording
- Example: "When this character quests or challenges..."

**Floating Triggered Abilities** (7.4.x) - Abilities that trigger from cards not in play

- The ability still triggers even though the card is gone

- Created by other effects
- Example: "At the start of your next turn, draw 2 cards"

- See Section 1.7 and 8.7 for complete bag rules
- Active player always chooses which ability resolves next
- Each ability resolves completely before choosing the next

### Steps to Use Activated Abilities:
1. Announce you're using the ability
2. Choose targets (if required)
3. Determine total cost (base cost + modifiers)
4. Pay the cost
5. Ability effect resolves

### Paying Costs (7.5.x):
- Costs must be paid in full
- Can't use an ability if you can't pay the full cost
