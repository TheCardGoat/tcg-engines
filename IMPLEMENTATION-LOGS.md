# Implementation Log

## 2025-01-15 - TCG Engine Move Enumeration System - Phase 3 Implementation Complete

### Completed Implementation Tasks

1. **Core Engine Integration**
   - Fixed import errors in core-engine.ts
   - Updated the MoveProcessor to fully utilize EnumerableMove features
   - Implemented proper MoveProvider interface in the CoreEngine class
   - Added type safety to the MoveEnumerationService initialization

2. **Enhanced Move Types**
   - Implemented target specifications with dependencies, exclusivity groups, and render hints
   - Added support for rich move metadata to improve UI organization
   - Created best practices documentation for creating EnumerableMove objects

3. **Reference Implementation**
   - The Lorcana putACardIntoTheInkwell move now fully demonstrates Phase 3 features
   - Serves as an example for implementing other game-specific moves

4. **Documentation**
   - Created BEST-PRACTICES.md with guidelines for creating EnumerableMove objects
   - Added detailed examples of common patterns and advanced features

### Next Steps

1. **Game Engine Updates**
   - Update other game engines (Gundam, Alpha Clash, etc.) to use EnumerableMove objects
   - Convert legacy function-based moves to the new EnumerableMove format

2. **Comprehensive Testing**
   - Create tests for constraint validation
   - Test target dependency resolution
   - Test exclusivity group functionality

3. **UI Integration**
   - Leverage new metadata and rendering hints in the game UI
   - Implement dynamic target selection based on dependencies

## 2025-01-10 - TCG Engine Move Enumeration System - Current Status

### Phase 3 Implementation Status

The Move Enumeration System Phase 3 implementation has been partially completed with the following components:

1. **Enhanced Move Types**
   - Added metadata support to EnumerableMove interface
   - Extended TargetSpec with exclusivity groups, render hints, and dependencies
   - Added types for richer move information

2. **Move Enumeration Service**
   - Added support for dependency tracking between targets
   - Improved error reporting for move availability

3. **Helper Functions**
   - Created helpers.ts with utility functions for move creation and manipulation
   - Added type-safe functions for accessing move properties

### Next Steps

1. **Core Engine Integration**
   - Fix remaining import errors in core-engine.ts
   - Update the MoveProcessor to fully utilize EnumerableMove features
   - Remove old function-based move interfaces after all moves are converted

2. **Game Engine Tests**
   - Create comprehensive tests for constraint validation
   - Test target dependency resolution
   - Test the exclusivity group functionality

3. **Lorcana Reference Implementation**
   - Fix type errors in the Lorcana putACardIntoTheInkwell move
   - Create additional reference implementations for other games

4. **Documentation**
   - Document best practices for creating EnumerableMoves
   - Create examples of common patterns
