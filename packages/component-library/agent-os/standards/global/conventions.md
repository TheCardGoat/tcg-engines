## Component library development conventions

- **Consistent Project Structure**: Organize components in a predictable structure (components/, utils/, types/) that users can navigate easily
- **Clear Documentation**: Maintain up-to-date component documentation with examples, prop interfaces, and usage guidelines
- **Semantic Versioning**: Follow semantic versioning (semver) for releases to communicate breaking changes and new features
- **Minimal Dependencies**: Keep dependencies minimal and well-documented; avoid heavy dependencies that bundle size
- **Code Review Process**: Review components for API design, accessibility, and reusability before merging
- **Component Testing**: Test components thoroughly with unit tests, visual tests, and interaction tests
- **Storybook Coverage**: Ensure all components have Storybook stories with comprehensive examples
- **Design System Consistency**: Maintain design tokens and component variants that work together cohesively
- **Changelog Maintenance**: Keep a changelog to track breaking changes, new features, and improvements for users
