# Product Mission

## Pitch
The TCG Component Library is a comprehensive UI component library that helps developers build trading card game engines by providing a complete set of reusable TCG-specific components and building blocks for implementing card games efficiently.

## Users

### Primary Customers
- **TCG Engine Developers**: Developers building trading card game engines who need comprehensive UI components
- **Game Development Studios**: Teams creating custom trading card games who want to accelerate development
- **Open Source Contributors**: Developers working on TCG projects who need standardized UI components

### User Personas
**TCG Developer** (25-45)
- **Role:** Frontend/Game Developer
- **Context:** Building trading card game engines, either commercial or open source
- **Pain Points:** Repetitive UI development, lack of TCG-specific components, need to rebuild common game elements
- **Goals:** Accelerate development, maintain consistency, focus on game logic rather than UI implementation

## The Problem

### No Standardized TCG UI Solution
Developers building trading card games must repeatedly create the same UI components—card previews, game tables, zone layouts, animations, and TCG-specific icons—from scratch for each project. This results in significant development time waste and inconsistent implementations across different TCG engines.

**Our Solution:** A comprehensive, extensible component library specifically designed for trading card games that provides all the essential UI building blocks while maintaining flexibility for custom game implementations.

## Differentiators

### First-of-its-Kind TCG-Specific Library
Unlike generic component libraries or custom-built solutions, we provide the first comprehensive component library specifically designed for trading card games. This results in dramatically reduced development time, consistent TCG UI patterns, and the ability to focus on game logic rather than UI implementation.

### Extensible Building Blocks Approach
Instead of rigid, opinionated components, we provide flexible building blocks that can be combined and customized for any TCG implementation. This results in maximum flexibility while still providing significant development acceleration.
