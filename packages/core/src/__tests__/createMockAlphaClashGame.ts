 * - Nine distinct zones including Contender, Clashground, Standby, and Oblivion
 * - Turn structure: Start of Turn â†’ Expansion (Ready/Draw/Resource) â†’ Primary â†’ End of Turn
 * - First player skips Ready and Draw steps on their first turn
 * - Clash Phase with six distinct steps (Attack, Counter, Obstruct, Clash Buffs, Damage)
