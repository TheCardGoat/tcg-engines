1. Game Concepts 

## 100. General 

100.1. These Alpha Clash Trading Card Game rules apply to any game with two or more players, including two-player games and multiplayer games involving Alpha Clash Trading Card Game cards. 

100.1a. A two-player game is a game that begins with only two players. 

100.1b. Multiplayer formats are in development and are coming soon\! 

100.2. To play, each player needs their own deck of Alpha Clash Trading Card Game cards, smal items to represent any tokens and Counters, and some way to clearly track Contender health totals. 

100.2a. In constructed play \(a means of playing in which each player creates their own deck ahead of time\), each deck has a required deck size of exactly 50 cards. This deck is also referred to as a player’s Main Deck. A constructed deck may contain no more than four of any card with a unique English name \(including Sideboard\); may contain no more than one card with the Unrivaled ability \(including Sideboard\); may contain no more than four Clash Buffs \(including Sideboard\) and must contain exactly one Contender card \(including Sideboard\). For the purposes of deck construction, cards with interchangeable names have the same English name \(see rule 201.3\). 

100.3. Some cards may require coins or traditional dice. Additional y, cards may require additional items, such as special y designated tokens. 

100.4. Each player may also have a Sideboard, which is a group of additional cards the player may use to modify their deck between games of a match. 

100.4a. In constructed play, a Sideboard may contain no more than 10 cards. The four-card limit, Unrivaled limit, Clash Buff limit, and Contender limit applies to the combined Main Deck and Sideboard \(see rule 100.2a\). 

100.5. If a deck must contain at least a certain number of cards, that number is referred to as a minimum deck size. 

100.6. Most Alpha Clash Trading Card Game tournaments \(organized play activities where players compete against other players to win prizes\) have additional rules covered in the Alpha Clash Trading Card Game Tournament Rules Manual, found at alphaclashtcg.com. These rules may limit the use of some cards, including barring some or al cards from specific sets. 

100.6a. Tournaments usual y consist of a series of matches. A two-player match usual y involves playing until one player has won two games. A multiplayer match usual y consists of only one game. 

100.6b. Players can go to play.alphaclashtcg.com to find tournaments in their area. 



101. Golden Rules 

101.1. Whenever a card’s text directly contradicts these rules, the card takes precedence. The card overrides only the rule that applies to that specific situation. The only exception is that a player can concede the game at any time \(see rule 104.3a\). 

101.2. When a rule or effect al ows or directs something to happen, and another effect states that it can’t happen, the “can’t” effect takes precedence. 

Example: If one effect reads “You may draw one additional card during your draw step” and another reads “You can’t draw cards this turn,” the effect that precludes you from drawing cards wins. 

101.3. Any part of an instruction that’s impossible to perform is ignored. 

101.4. If multiple players would make choices and/or take actions at the same time, the active player \(the player whose turn it is\) makes any choices required, then the next player in turn order \(usual y the player seated to the active player’s left\) makes any choices required, fol owed by the remaining nonactive players in turn order. Then the resulting action of those choices happen simultaneously. This rule is often referred to as the “Active Player, Nonactive Player \(APNAP\) order” rule. 

Example: A card reads “Each player may reveal the top three cards of their deck. If they do, they may put a non-Clash card with an initial resource cost of three or less from among them into their hand. Then put the remaining cards on the bottom of their deck.” First, the active player chooses whether to reveal the top three cards of their deck. Then each of the nonactive players, in turn order, chooses whether to do the same. Then al players who chose to reveal do so simultaneously. Then the active player may choose a card from among them to add to their hand. Then each of the nonactive players \(who chose to reveal\), in turn order, chooses whether to do the same. Final y, al cards chosen are added to their owners’ hands simultaneously. 

101.4a. If an effect has each player choose a card in a hidden zone, such as their hand or deck, those cards may remain face down as they’re chosen. However, each player must clearly indicate which face-down card they are choosing. 

101.4b. Any text that includes a “may” phrasing indicates a choice of an optional effect to be made. 

101.4c. A player knows the choices made by the previous players when making their choice, except as specified in rule 101.4a. 

101.4d. If a player would make more than one choice at the same time, the player makes the choices in the order specified. If no order is specified, the player chooses the order. 

101.4e. If a choice made by a nonactive player causes the active player, or a different nonactive player earlier in the turn order, to have to make a choice, APNAP order is restarted for al outstanding choices. 

101.4f. If multiple players would make choices or take actions while starting the game, the starting player is considered the active player and each other player is considered a nonactive player. 

101.5. If a ruling does not exist within these chapters, reference the Specific Card Rulings at the end of this document for more clarification. 

## 102. Players 

102.1. A player is one of the people in the game. The active player is the player whose turn it is. 

The other players are nonactive players. 

102.2. In a two-player game, a player’s opponent is the other player. 

102.3. In a multiplayer game, a player’s opponents are the other players. 

## 103. Starting the Game 

103.1. At the start of a game, the players reveal their chosen Contender to each other. Then the players randomly determine which one of them wil take the first turn. In the first game of a match \(including a single-game match\), the players may use any mutual y agreeable method \(flipping a coin, rol ing dice, etc.\) to do so. In a match of several games, the loser of the previous game chooses who takes the first turn in the next game. If the previous game was a draw, the player who made the choice in that game makes the choice in this game. The player chosen to take the first turn is the starting player. The game’s default turn order begins with the starting player and proceeds clockwise. 

103.2. Some games require additional steps that are taken after the starting player has been determined. Perform the actions listed in 103.2a–b in order, as applicable. 

103.2a. If any players are using Sideboards those cards are set aside. \(see rule 100.4\). 

After this happens, each player’s deck is considered their starting deck. 

103.2b. In any game of Alpha Clash, each player puts their Contender face up into their Contender Zone at the start of the game. 

103.3. After the starting player has been determined and any additional steps performed, each player shuffles their deck so that the cards are in a random order. Each player may then shuffle or cut their opponents’ decks. 

103.3a. At the start of the game and whenever a player shuffles their deck, that player is required to offer their deck to their opponent to be cut and/or shuffled. 

103.4. Each player’s Contender begins the game with a starting health total as indicated on that Contender’s card. 

103.5. Each player draws a number of cards equal to their starting hand size, which is normal y eight. \(Some effects can modify a player’s starting hand size.\) A player who is dissatisfied with their initial hand may take one mul igan. First, the starting player declares whether they wil take a mul igan. Then each other player in turn order does the same. Once each player has made a declaration, al players who decided to take mul igans do so at the same time. To take a 

mul igan, a player shuffles a number of cards from their hand back into their deck, then draws that many cards. If a player chooses not to take a mul igan, the remaining cards become that player’s starting hand. Players are only permitted to take one mul igan. 

103.6. Some cards al ow a player to take an action “at the start of the game”. This action takes place after the first player is determined and after the mul igan process. 

103.6a. If a card al ows a player to begin the game with that card in play, the player taking this action puts that card into play from the appropriate zone. 

103.7. The starting player takes their first turn. 

103.7a. In a two-player game, the player who plays first skips the ready and draw step of their Expansion Phase on their first turn \(see rule 502.1\). 

## 104. Ending the Game 

104.1. A game ends immediately when a player wins, or when the game is a draw. 

104.2. There are several ways to win the game. 

104.2a. A player stil in the game wins the game if that player’s opponents have al left the game. This happens immediately and overrides al effects that would preclude that player from winning the game. 

104.2b. An effect may state that a player wins the game. 

104.2c. In the event where both Contender’s health is reduced to zero by clash damage, the active player \(the attacking player\) wins the game \(see rule 301.2c\). 

104.3. There are several ways to lose the game. 

104.3a. A player can concede the game at any time. A player who concedes leaves the game immediately. That player loses the game. 

104.3b. If a Contender’s health total is 0 or less, the player who owns that Contender loses the game after al cards or effects in Standby have resolved. This is a state-based action \(see rule 706\). 

104.3c. If a player would draw a card from their deck and can’t, they lose the game. An empty deck can’t prevent you from drawing from a card effect. 

104.3d. An effect may state that a player loses the game. 

104.3e. If a player would both win and lose the game simultaneously, that player loses the game. 

104.3g. In a tournament, a player may lose the game because of a penalty given by a judge \(see rule 100.6\). 

104.4. There are several ways for the game to be a draw. 

104.4a. If al the players remaining in a game lose simultaneously, the game is a draw. 

104.4b. An effect may state that the game is a draw. 

104.4c. An effect may result in a draw, such as simultaneous loss of health due to a card effect. 

104.4e. In a tournament, al players in the game may agree to an intentional draw \(see rule 100.6\). 

104.5. If a player loses the game, that player leaves the game. If the game is a draw for a player, that player leaves the game. 

104.6. In a tournament, a game may end due to a time limit in the round of play \(see the Alpha Clash Trading Card Game Tournament Rules Manual, for “End of Round” procedures\). 

## 105. Colors 

105.1. There are five colors in the Alpha Clash Trading Card Game: white, blue, black, red, and green. 

105.2. An object can be one or more of the five colors. The color of a card is indicated in numerous areas: the color\(s\) of the hex where a card’s initial resource cost is indicated; the color of the gems in a card’s specific resource cost; the color of the ATK/DEF background for a Contender or Clash card; and final y, the color is spel ed out in a card’s identification at the bottom right of the card. Al these areas are of equal authority in a card’s color determination. 



105.2a. A monocolored object is exactly one of the five colors. 



105.2b. A multicolored object is two or more of the five colors. 



105.2c. There are no colorless objects. 

105.3. Effects may change an object’s color or give an object a new color. If an effect gives an object a new color, the new color replaces al previous colors the object had \(unless the effect said the object became that color “in addition” to its other colors\). 

105.4. If a player is asked to choose a color, they must choose one of the five colors. 

“Multicolored” is not a color. 

## 106. Resources 

106.1. Players generate resources to pay costs, usual y when playing cards and activating effects. 

106.1a. There are five colors of resources: white, blue, black, red, and green. 

106.1b. There are no colorless resources. 

106.2. Resources can be represented by gem symbols within a card’s text \(see rule 107.4 and/or rule 202\). 

106.3. Resources are generated by cards in your Resource Zone \(see rule 408.7\). 

106.4. Resources may only be generated if the game state requires you to do so. In other words, you may not engage a card in your Resource Zone for no reason \(see rule 408.7a\). 

## 107. Numbers and Symbols 

107.1. The only numbers the Alpha Clash Trading Card Game uses are integers. 

107.1a. You can’t choose a fractional number, deal fractional damage, gain fractional health, and so on. If a card or effect could generate a fractional number, the card or effect wil tel you whether to round up or down. 

107.1b. Most of the time, the Alpha Clash Trading Card Game uses only positive numbers and zero. You can’t choose a negative number, deal negative damage, gain negative health, and so on. However, it’s possible for a game value, such as a Clash card’s attack power, to be less than zero. If a calculation or comparison needs to use a negative value, it does so. If a calculation that would determine the result of an effect yields a negative number, zero is used instead, unless that effect doubles or sets to a specific value a Contender’s health total or the attack and/or defense power of a Clash card. 

Example: If a 3/4 Clash card gets -5/-0, it’s now a -2/4 Clash card. It doesn’t deal clash damage in a Clash. Its total attack and defense power is 2. Giving it \+3/\+0 would raise its attack power to 1. 

107.1c. If a card or effect instructs a player to choose “any number,” that player may choose any positive number or zero. 

107.2. If anything needs to use a number that can’t be determined, either as a result or in a calculation, it uses zero instead. 

107.3. Many objects use the letter \[X\] as a placeholder for a number that needs to be determined. Some objects have effects or abilities that define the value of \[X\]; the rest let their control er choose the value of \[X\]. 

107.3a. If a card or effect has a resource cost, alternative cost, additional cost, and/or activation cost with an \[X\], or \[-X\] in it, and the value of X isn’t defined by the text of that card or effect, the control er of that card or effect chooses and declares the value of X as part of the playing of the card or activating of the effect \(see rule 601.1b\). While a card or effect is in Standby, any X in its resource cost, or in any alternative cost, or additional cost it has, equals the declared value. 

107.3b. If a player is playing a card that has an \[X\] in its resource cost and the value of X 

isn’t defined by the text of that card, or an effect lets that player play the card while paying neither its resource cost nor an alternative cost that includes \[X\], then the only legal choice for X is 0. This doesn’t apply to effects that only reduce a cost, even if they reduce it to zero \(see rule 601.1b\). 

107.3c. If a card or effect has an \[X\], or \[-X\], in its cost and/or its text, and the value of X 

is defined by the text of that card or effect, then that’s the value of X while that card or 





effect is in Standby. The control er of that card or effect doesn’t get to choose the value. 

Note: The value of X may change while that card or effect is in Standby. 

107.3d. If a card or effect refers to the \[X\] in the resource cost, alternative cost, additional cost, or activation cost of another object, any X in that card or effect’s text uses the value of X chosen or defined for the other object. 

107.3e. Sometimes X appears in the text of a card or effect but not in a resource cost, alternative cost, additional cost, or activation cost. If the value of X isn’t defined, the control er of the card or effect chooses the value of X at the appropriate time; either as it’s put into Standby or as it resolves. 

107.3f. If a card in any zone other than Standby has an \[X\] in its resource cost, the value of \[X\] is treated as 0, even if the value of X is defined somewhere within its text. 

107.3g. If an effect instructs a player to pay an object’s resource cost that includes \[X\], the value of X is treated as 0 unless the object is a card or effect in Standby. In that case, the value of X is the value chosen or determined for it as the card was played or the effect was activated. 

107.3h. Normal y, al instances of X on an object have the same value at any given time. 

107.3i. If a delayed triggered effect created by a resolving a card or effect refers to X, X 

is not defined in the text of that triggered effect, and the card or effect that created it had a value of X chosen for any of its costs, the value of X for the triggered effect is the same as the value of X for the card of effect that created it. 

107.4. Symbols include…the resource gem symbols \[⯁\], \[⯁\], \[⯁\], \[⯁\], and \[⯁\]; the variable symbol \[X\], \{30\} / \{10\} Contender ability health threshold symbols, and \[AH\], \[A\], \[R\], \[H\], \[D\], and \[P\] affiliation symbols. 

107.4a. There are five colored resource symbols: \[⯁\] is black, \[⯁\] green, \[⯁\] white, \[⯁\] 

blue, and \[⯁\] red. These symbols are used to represent colored resources, and to represent colored resources in costs. Colored resources in costs can be paid only with the appropriate colored resource \(see rule 202\). 

107.4b. The \{30\} Contender ability health threshold symbol indicates that at \{30\} or less health, that ability is active. This also applies to any other Contender ability health threshold symbol. A Contender ability is active only while that Contender is at or below the corresponding health indicated for that ability \(see rule 116.7\). 

107.4c. The symbols are used to indicate or reference a specific affiliation \(see rule 208\). 

107.4d. The symbol \[0\] represents zero resources and is used as a placeholder for a cost that can be paid with no resources \(see rule 115.5\). 



108. Cards 

108.1. Use the Clarified Card Reference \(see Appendix B\) when determining a card’s correct wording. A card’s Clarified text can also be found in the official card database at alphaclashtcg.com 

108.2. When a rule or text on a card refers to a “card,” it means only an Alpha Clash Trading Card Game card, or an object represented by an Alpha Clash Trading Card Game card. 

108.2a. Most Alpha Clash games use only traditional Alpha Clash Trading Card Game cards, which measure approximately 2.48 inches \(6.3 cm\) by 3.46 inches \(8.8 cm\). 

108.2b. Tokens aren’t considered cards—even a card-sized game supplement that represents a token isn’t considered a card for rules purposes. 

108.3. The owner of a card in the game is the player who started the game with it in their deck. 

If a card is brought into the game from outside the game rather than starting in a player’s deck, its owner is the player who brought it into the game. If a card starts the game in the Contender Zone, its owner is the player who put it into the Contender Zone to start the game. Legal ownership of a card in the game is irrelevant to the game rules. 

108.4. A card doesn’t have a control er unless that card is represented in a valid game zone; in those cases, its control er is determined by the rules for that card \(see rule 110.2\). 

108.4a. If anything asks for the control er of a card that doesn’t have one, use its owner instead. 

108.5. For more information about cards, see Chapter 2. 

## 109. Objects 

109.1. An object is an effect in Standby a copy of an effect in Standby, a card, a copy of a card, or a token. 

109.2. If a card or effect uses a description of an object that includes a card type or subtype, but doesn’t include the word “card,” or “source,” it means an object of that card type or subtype in play. 

109.2a. If a card or effect uses a description of an object that includes the word “card” 

and the name of a zone, it means a card matching that description in the stated zone. 

109.2b. If a card or effect uses a description of an object that includes the word “effect,” 

it means an effect matching that description in Standby. 

109.2c. If a card or effect uses a description of an object that includes the word 

“source,” it means a source matching that description \(a source of an effect, of damage, or of a card\) in any zone. 

109.3. An object’s characteristics can include name, resource cost, specific resource cost, color, card type, subtype, text, character name, location name, planet, abilities, attack power, and defense power. Objects can have some or al these characteristics. Any other information about 

an object isn’t a characteristic. For example, characteristics don’t include whether a permanent is engaged, a card effect’s target, an object’s owner or control er, an attached Weapon or Clash card, and so on. 

109.4. Only objects in Standby or in play have a control er. Objects that are neither in Standby nor in play aren’t control ed by any player \(see rule 108.4\). There is one exception to this rule: 109.4a. A triggered effect that has triggered but is waiting to be placed into Standby is control ed by the player who control ed its source at the time it triggered unless it’s a delayed triggered effect. To determine the control er of a delayed triggered effect, see rules 603.7. 

109.5. The words “you” and “your” on an object refer to the object’s control er, its would-be control er \(if a player is attempting to play, or activate it\), or its owner \(if it has no control er\). 

For a static effect, this is the current control er of the object it’s on. For an activated effect, this is the player who activated the effect. For a triggered effect, this is the control er of the object when the effect triggered, unless it’s a delayed triggered effect. To determine the control er of a delayed triggered effect, see rules 603.7. 

## 110. Permanents 

110.1. A permanent is only considered in play if it’s in a valid game zone. A permanent in play remains in play indefinitely; except if it were in Standby. 

110.2. Every permanent has a control er. 

110.2a. The term “permanent” is used to refer to a card that could be put into play. 

Specifical y, it means a Contender, Clash card, Clashground, or Accessory. 

110.2b. If an effect instructs a player to put a permanent into play, that permanent enters play under that player’s control unless the effect states otherwise. 

110.2b.1. Any permanent in a public zone \(other than a player’s Oblivion\) is considered in play. 

110.2c. If an effect causes a player to gain control of another player’s permanent, the player who took control of the permanent is now the control er of that object. That object does not leave and re-enter play, it simply changes zones. The change is permanent until that particular object leaves and re-enters play. 

110.2d. Permanents of various types enter play into their corresponding zones. There are four types of permanents that this rule applies to: Contenders, Clash cards, Clashgrounds, and Accessories. 

110.2e. Action cards can’t enter play and thus are not permanents. 

110.2f. If a permanent somehow loses al its card types, it remains in play. It’s stil a permanent. 

110.3. A permanent’s status is its physical state. There are two status categories, each of which has two possible values: ready/engaged and face up/face down. Each permanent always has one of these values for each of these categories. 

110.3a. Status is not a characteristic, though it may affect a permanent’s characteristics. 

110.3b. Permanents enter play ready and, face up; except for Traps, they enter face down. 

110.3c. Only permanents have status. Cards not in play do not. Similarly, cards not in play are neither ready nor engaged, regardless of their physical state. 

## 111. Tokens 

111.1. Some effects create tokens. A token is a marker used to represent any permanent that isn’t represented by a card. 

111.2. The player who creates a token is its owner. The token enters play under that player’s control in the ready position in that card’s corresponding zone, based on its type indicated in the creation effect for that token. 

111.3. The card or effect that creates a token may define the values of any number of characteristics for the token. This becomes the token’s “text”. The characteristic values defined this way are functional y equivalent to the characteristic values that are printed on a card; for example, they define the token’s copiable values. A token doesn’t have any characteristics not defined by the card or effect that created it. 

111.4. A card or effect that creates a token may set its name, type, affiliation, or any other card characteristics associated with a card. 

111.5. If a card or effect would create a token, but a rule or effect states that a permanent with one or more of that token’s characteristics can’t enter play, the token is not created. Similarly, if an effect would create a token that is a copy of an Action card, no token is created. 

111.6. A token is subject to anything that affects permanents in general or that affects the token’s card characteristics. While a token is in play, it is considered a card. 

111.7. A token that’s in a zone other than the Clash Zone, Clashground Zone, Accessory Zone, or Resource Zone ceases to exist. This is a state-based action \(see rule 706\). 

Note: If a token changes zones, applicable triggered effects wil trigger before the token ceases to exist. 

111.8. A token that has left play can’t come back into play. It ceases to exist the next time state-based actions are checked \(see rule 706\). 

111.9. A token that has the subtype Weapon may change zones \(Clash Zone and Accessory Zone\). 



112. Card Effects 

112.1. A card effect can be one of two things: 

112.1a. A card effect can be a characteristic an object has that al ows it to affect the game. An object’s card effects are defined by its rules text or by the source that created it. Effects can also be granted to objects by other cards. Effects that grant effects/abilities usual y use the words “gets,” or “get” \(see rule 112.7\). 

112.1b. A card effect can be an activated or triggered effect in Standby. This kind of effect is an object. 

112.2. Effects can affect the objects they’re on. They can also affect other objects and/or players. 

112.2a. Effects can be beneficial or detrimental. 

Example: “\[This Clash card\] can’t be obstructed” is a card effect. 

112.2b. An additional cost or alternative cost to play a card or activate an effect is a card effect. 

112.2c. An object may have multiple effects. If the object is represented by a card, then aside from certain defined abilities that may be strung together on a single line \(see rule 704\), each paragraph break in a card’s text marks a separate card effect. If the object is not represented by a card, the source that created it may have given it multiple effects. 

An object may also be granted additional effects by a card or effect. If an object has multiple instances of the same effect, each instance functions independently. This may or may not produce more effects than a single instance. 

112.2d. Card effects can be one-shot effects or continuous effects. Some continuous effects are replacement effects or prevention effects \(see rule 609 and 610\). 

112.3. There are three general categories of card effects. 

112.3a. Activated effects have a cost. A player may activate such an effect whenever they have priority. Doing so puts it into Standby, where it remains until it’s negated, it resolves, or it otherwise leaves Standby \(see rule 602\). 

112.3b. Triggered effects have a trigger condition. They are written as “\[Trigger condition\], \[effect\],” and include \(and usual y begin with\) the word “when,” 

“whenever,” or “at.” Whenever the trigger event occurs, the owner of that effect gains priority and the effect is put into Standby and stays there until it’s negated, it resolves, or it otherwise leaves Standby \(see rule 603\). 

112.3c. Static effects are written as statements. They’re simply true. Static effects are continuous effects which are active while the permanent with the effect is in play and has the effect, or while the object with the effect is in the appropriate zone \(see rule 604\). 



112.4. Card effects have additional functions. 

112.4a. An effect that states which zones it functions in functions only from those zones. 

112.4b. An effect that states which zones it doesn’t function in functions everywhere except for the specified zones, even outside the game and before the game begins. 

112.4c. An object’s effect that restricts or modifies how that object can be played functions in any zone from which it could be played and in Standby. An object’s effect that grants it another effect that restricts or modifies how that object can be played functions only in Standby. 

112.4d. An object’s effect that restricts or modifies what zones that object can be played from functions everywhere, even outside the game. 

112.4e. An object’s effect that modifies how that object enters play functions as that object is entering play. 

112.4f. An object’s effect that states Counters can’t be put on that object functions as that object is entering play in addition to functioning while that object is in play. 

112.4g. An effect whose cost specifies that it moves the object it’s on out of a particular zone function only in that zone, unless its trigger condition or a previous part of its cost or effect specifies that the object is put into that zone. The same is true if the effect creates a delayed triggered effect whose effect moves the object out of a particular zone. 

112.5. The source of an effect is the object that generated it. The source of an activated effect in Standby is the object whose effect was activated. The source of a triggered effect \(other than a delayed triggered effect\) in Standby, or one that has triggered and is waiting to be put into Standby, is the object whose effect triggered. To determine the source of a delayed triggered effect, see rules 603.7. 

112.6. The control er of an activated effect in Standby is the player who activated it. The control er of a triggered effect in Standby \(other than a delayed triggered effect\) is the player who control ed the effect’s source when it triggered, or, if it had no control er, the player who owned the effect’s source when it triggered. To determine the control er of a delayed triggered effect, see rules 603.7. 

112.7. Card effects can add or remove effects of objects. A card effect that adds an effect wil state that the object “gets” or “get” that effect, or similar. A card effect that removes an effect wil state that the object “loses” that effect. 

112.7a. A card effect that adds an activated effect may include activation instructions for that effect. These instructions become part of the effect that’s added to the object. 

112.7b. Card effects that remove an effect remove al instances of it. 

112.8. Effects can stop an object from having a specified effect. These effects say that the object 

“can’t have” that effect. If the object has that effect, it loses it. It’s also impossible for an effect to add that effect to the object. If a resolving card or effect creates a continuous effect that 

would add the specified effect to such an object, that part of that continuous effect does not apply; however, other parts of that continuous effect wil stil apply, and that resolving card or effect can stil create other continuous effects. Continuous effects created by static effects that would add the specified effect won’t apply to that object. 

112.9. An effect that sets an object’s characteristic, or simply states a quality of that object, is different from an effect granted by a card effect. When an object “gets” an effect such as this, that effect can be removed by another card effect. 

112.10. If a card or effect references “you” or “your…” it is referring to the player that controls that card or effect \(see rule 109.5\). 

## 113. Targeting 

113.1. Some cards and effects require their control er to choose one or more targets for them. 

The targets are object\(s\) and/or player\(s\) the card or effect wil affect. These targets are declared as part of the process of putting the card or effect into Standby. The targets can’t be changed except by another card or effect that explicitly says it can do so. 

113.1a. An action card is targeted if its card effect identifies something it wil affect by using the phrase “target \[something\],” where the “something” is a phrase that describes an object and/or player. The target\(s\) are chosen as the card is played \(see rule 601.1c\). 

If an activated or triggered effect of an action card uses the word target, only the effect is targeted. 

Example: An Action card has the effect “Target Clash card you control gets \+1/\+1 until end of turn.” This triggered effect is targeted, but that doesn’t make the card it’s on targeted. 

113.1b. An activated effect is targeted if it identifies something it wil affect by using the phrase “target \[something\],” where the “something” is a phrase that describes an object and/or player. The target\(s\) are chosen as the effect is activated \(see rule 602.2b\). 

113.1c. A triggered effect is targeted if it identifies something it wil affect by using the phrase “target \[something\],” where the “something” is a phrase that describes an object and/or player. The target\(s\) are chosen as the effect is put into Standby \(see rule 603.3d\). 

113.1d. Some keyword actions, such as “attach”, represent targeted activated or triggered effects. In those cases, the phrase “target \[something\]” appears in the rule for that keyword action rather than in the ability itself. The keyword’s reminder text wil often contain the word “target” \(see rule 703\). 

113.1e. The “attach” ability of a Weapon is a targeted activated effect. 

113.2. Only permanents are legal targets for cards and effects, unless a card or effect \(a\) specifies that it can target an object in another zone or a player, or \(b\) targets an object that can’t exist in play, such as a card or effect. 

113.3. The same target can’t be chosen multiple times for any one instance of the word “target” 

on a card or effect. If the card or effect uses the word “target” in multiple places, the same object or player can be chosen once for each instance of the word “target” \(if it fits the targeting criteria\). This rule applies both when choosing targets for a card or effect and when changing targets or choosing new targets for a card or effect. 

113.4. Some cards and effects that refer to damage wil always refer to either a Clash card or a Contender. Other game objects, such as Accessories or Clashgrounds, can’t be chosen as the target of damage. 

113.5. A card or effect in Standby is an il egal target for itself. 

113.6. A card or effect that requires targets may al ow zero targets to be chosen. Such a card or effect is stil said to require targets, but that card or effect is targeted only if one or more targets have been chosen for it. 

113.7. Some effects al ow a player to change the target\(s\) of a card or effect, and other effects al ow a player to choose new targets for a card or effect. 

113.7a. If an effect al ows a player to “change the target\(s\)” of a card or effect, each target can be changed only to another legal target. If a target can’t be changed to another legal target, the original target is unchanged, even if the original target is itself il egal by then. If al the targets aren’t changed to other legal targets, none of them are changed. 

113.7b. If an effect al ows a player to “change a target” of a card or effect, the process described in rule 113.7a is fol owed, except that only one of those targets may be changed \(rather than al of them or none of them\). 

113.7c. If an effect al ows a player to “change any targets” of a card or effect, the process described in rule 113.7a is fol owed, except that any number of those targets may be changed \(rather than al of them or none of them\). 

113.7d. If an effect al ows a player to “choose new targets” for a card or effect, the player may leave any number of the targets unchanged, even if those targets would be il egal. If the player chooses to change some or al the targets, the new targets must be legal and must not cause any unchanged targets to become il egal. 

113.7e. When changing targets or choosing new targets for a card or effect, only the final set of targets are evaluated to determine whether the change is legal. 

113.7f. A card or effect may “divide” or “distribute” an effect \(such as damage or Counters\) among one or more targets. When changing targets or choosing new targets for that card or effect, the original division can’t be changed. 

113.8. Modal cards and effects may have different targeting requirements for each mode. An effect that al ows a player to change the target\(s\) of a modal card or effect, or to choose new targets for a modal card or effect, doesn’t al ow that player to change its mode \(see rule 702\). 

113.9. Some objects check what another card or effect is targeting. Depending on the wording, these may check the current state of the targets, the state of the targets at the time they were selected, or both. 

113.9a. An object that looks for a “\[card or effect\] with \[a number of\] targets” checks the number of times any object or player was chosen as the target of that card or effect when it was put into Standby, not the number of its targets that are currently legal. If the same object or player became a target more than once, each of those instances is counted separately. 

113.9b. An object that looks for a “\[card or effect\] that targets \[something\]” checks the current state of that card or effect’s targets. If an object it targets is stil in the zone it’s expected to be in or a player it targets is stil in the game, that target’s current information is used, even if it’s not currently legal for that card or effect. If an object it targets is no longer in the zone it’s expected to be in or a player it targets is no longer in the game, that target is ignored; its last known information is not used. 

113.9c. An object that looks for a “\[card or effect\] that targets only \[something\]” checks the number of different objects or players that were chosen as targets of that card or effect when it was put into Standby \(as modified by effects that changed those targets\), not the number of those objects or players that are currently legal targets. If that number is one \(even if the card or effect targets that object or player multiple times\), the current state of that card or effect’s target is checked as described in rule 113.9b. 

113.10. Cards and effects can affect objects and players they don’t target. In general, those objects and players aren’t chosen until the card or effect resolves. 

113.10a. Just because an object or player is being affected by a card or effect doesn’t make that object or player a target of that card or effect. Unless that object or player is identified by the word “target” in the text of that card or effect, or the rule for that keyword ability, the card or effect is not targeted. 

113.10b. In particular, the word “you” in an object’s text doesn’t indicate a target. 

114. Action Windows & Priority 

114.1. Players only have priority to respond to their opponent’s actions during specified action windows, based on an effect’s trigger tag and timing rules. 

114.1a. A player may only respond to an “incoming attack” with a card or effect with the Counter – Attack tag. This can only occur in a clash during the Counter Step. The defending player has priority in the Counter Step. 

114.1b. A player may respond when an opponent “plays a card” with a card or effect with the Counter – Play tag. This can occur during any phase. After a card is played, it enters Standby, and each player in turn order has priority to respond with Counter – 

Play effects. 

114.1c. A player may respond when an opponent “activates a Trap” with a card or effect with the Counter – Trap tag. This can occur during any phase. After a Trap is activated, it’s effect enters Standby, and each player in turn order has priority to respond with Counter – Trap effects. 

114.1d. A player has priority to resolve a triggered effect when that effect’s specific trigger condition has been met. That player gains priority to resolve their triggered effect, then priority is returned to the active player. This can occur during any phase. 



114.2. Which player has priority is determined by the fol owing rules: 114.2a. The active player receives priority at the beginning of their turn. 

114.2b. Non-active players \(in turn order\) receive priority after a card or effect enters Standby. 

114.2c. If a non-active player has priority and chooses not to take any actions, that player passes. Then the next non-active player in turn order receives priority. 

114.2d. The active player regains priority after the active card or effect in Standby has resolved. 

114.3. If a player with priority plays a card or responds with an effect while another card or effect is already in Standby, the new card or effect that has been played or activated “in response to” the earlier card or effect wil resolve first \(see rule 605\). 

## 115. Costs 

115.1. A cost is an action or payment necessary to take another action or to stop another action from taking place. To pay a cost, a player carries out the instructions specified by the card, ability, or effect that contains that cost. 

115.2. A player can’t pay a resource cost without having the necessary resources to pay it ful y. 

For example, a player with only one ready resource can’t pay a cost of two resources, and a permanent that’s already engaged can’t be engaged to pay a cost \(see rule 202, 120 and 602\). 

115.3. The cost to activate an effect can be spel ed out in a card’s text prior to the phrase, “If you do.. ” \(for example, Once per turn, during your Primary Phase, you may engage this card. If you do, deal one damage to target Contender or Clash card.\) 115.3a. The cost outlined in the above example is “Once per turn, during your Primary Phase, you may engage this card…” and the resulting effect \(if the cost is paid\) is “deal one damage to target Contender or Clash card.” 

115.3b. Paying resources is done by engaging the indicated colored cards in a player’s Resource Zone. A player may not engage a resource for no reason. The game state must require a resource cost to be paid. \(Players can always pay 0 resources.\) 115.3c. Paying health is done by subtracting the indicated amount of health from a Contender’s health total. \(Players can always pay 0 health.\) 115.4. Some costs include an \[X\] \(see rule 107.3\). 

115.5. Some costs are represented by \[0\] or are reduced to \[0\]. The action necessary for a player to pay such a cost is the player’s acknowledgment that they are paying it. Even though such a cost requires no resources, it’s not automatical y paid. 

115.5a. A card whose resource cost is \[0\] must stil be played the same way as one with a cost greater than zero; it won’t play itself automatical y. The same is true for an activated effect whose cost is \[0\]. 

115.6. Specific resource costs can be reduced by card effects. 

Example: This card cost \[⯁\] less to play for each unattached Weapon you control. 

115.3a. A card or effect can only be discounted by its specific resource cost. 

115.3b. Reducing a specific resource cost reduces the total cost of that card or effect AND reduces the specific resource cost of that card or effect. 

Example: Applying the discounted cost from the example above, if you have a card that has an initial resource cost of 8 and a specific resource cost of \[⯁⯁⯁⯁\], it wil now cost 7 and its specific resource cost would be \[⯁⯁⯁\]. 

115.3c. The cost of a card or an effect can only be reduced by an amount of specific resources indicated on that card or effect. 

Example: If a card has an initial resource cost of 3 and a specific resource cost of \[⯁⯁\], and you apply an effect that makes it cost \[⯁⯁⯁\] less, that card would only be discounted by \[⯁⯁\] and would cost 1 resource of any color. 

115.8. Some cards and effects have additional costs. An additional cost is a cost listed in a card’s text or applied to a card or effect from another effect, that its control er must pay at the same time they pay the card’s resource cost or the effect’s resource cost. 

115.8a. Any number of additional costs may be applied to a card as it’s being played or to an effect as it’s being activated. The control er of the card or effect declares their intention to pay any or al those costs as described in rule 601. 

115.8b. Some additional costs are optional. 

115.8c. If an effect instructs a player to play a card “if able,” and that card has a mandatory additional cost that includes actions involving cards with a stated quality in a hidden zone, the player isn’t required to play that card, even if those cards are present in that zone. 

115.8d. Additional costs don’t change a card’s resource cost, only what its control er must pay to play it. Cards and effects that ask for that card’s resource cost stil see the original value. 

115.9. Some cards and effects have alternative costs. An alternative cost is a cost listed in a card’s text, or applied to it from another effect, that its control er may pay rather than paying the card’s resource cost. Alternative costs are usual y phrased, “…you may play this card from your hand without paying its resource cost.” 

115.9a. Only one alternative cost can be applied to any one card or effect as it’s being played or activated. The control er of the card or effect declares their intention to pay that cost as described in rule 601.1f. 

115.9b. Alternative costs are general y optional. An effect that al ows you to play a card or activate an effect may require a certain alternative cost to be paid. 

115.9c. An alternative cost doesn’t change a card or an effect’s resource cost, only what its control er must pay to play it. Cards and effects that ask for that card or that effect’s resource cost stil see the original value. 

115.9d. If an alternative cost is being paid to play a card or activate an effect, any additional costs, cost increases, and cost reductions that affect that card or effect are applied to that alternative cost \(see rule 601.1f\). 

## 116. Health 

116.1. Each Contender begins the game with a specified health total as indicated on that Contender’s card. Some Contenders may have different starting health totals. 

116.2. Damage dealt to a Contender normal y causes that Contender to lose that much health \(see rule 117\). 

116.3. If an effect causes a Contender to gain health or lose health, that Contender’s health total is adjusted accordingly. 

116.4. If a cost or effect al ows a player to pay an amount of health greater than 0, the player may do so only if their Contender’s health total is greater than or equal to the amount of the payment. If a player pays health, the payment is subtracted from their Contender’s health total; in other words, the Contender loses that much health. 

116.4a. Players can always pay 0 health, no matter what their Contender’s health total is, and even if an effect says players can’t pay health. 

116.5. If an effect “sets” a Contender’s health total to a specific number or says that a Contender’s health total now “is \[X\], the Contender’s health is increased or decreased to match the indicated number. 

116.5a. Setting a Contender’s health total is not gaining or losing health, therefore if an effect states that Contenders can’t lose or gain health, the effect of “setting” a Contender’s health to a specific number wil stil resolve. 

116.6. If a Contender has 0 or less health, that Contender’s control er loses the game as a state-based action \(see rule 706\). 

116.7. Contender abilities are triggered static effects that are only active when a Contender is at or below the indicated health threshold \(see rule 107.4b\). 

Example: Your Contender is at 10 health and your bottom ability is active. If you Contender were to gain two health, your bottom ability would become inactive and would not become active again until your Contender is at or below 10 health. 

## 117. Damage 

117.1. Objects can deal damage to Clash cards and Contenders. This is general y detrimental to the object or Contender that receives that damage. An object that deals damage is the source of that damage. 

117.1a. Damage can’t be dealt to an object that’s neither a Clash card nor a Contender. 

117.2. Damage persists upon an object based on the type of damage dealt. There are two types of damage: clash and non-clash damage. 

117.2a. Damage may be dealt as a result of a clash. This is considered clash damage. 

Each Contender and/or Clash card involved in a clash deals clash damage equal to its attack during the damage step. Clash damage only persists for the clash in which it was dealt. In other words, clash damage is removed at the end of the clash in which it was dealt. 

117.2b. Damage may be dealt by a card effect. This is considered non-clash damage. 

Any card or effect that deals damage other than from a Clash card’s attack power \(in a clash\) qualifies as non-clash damage. Non-clash damage persists for the turn in which it was it was dealt. In other words, non-clash damage is removed at the end of the turn in which it was dealt. 

117.2b.1. If a Contender is dealt non-clash damage, first, that Contender’s defense is reduced by the amount of damage dealt. If there is excessive non-clash damage, then, the Contender’s health is reduced by that amount. 

Example: Player A controls a Contender with an attack/defense value of 0/1. 

Player B plays \[Solar Smash\] and deals three damage to Player A’s Contender. 

Player A’s Contender is now a 0/0 and the 2 excessive non-clash damage reduces that Contender’s health by two. Player A’s Contender wil remain a 0/0 for the duration of the turn in which that damage was dealt. 

117.3. Excessive damage, such as that from Breakthrough \(see rule 704.4\), is dealt as an additional instance of clash damage to an opponent’s Contender. 

Example: If an attacking Clash card with Breakthrough has an attack/defense of 4/2 and the obstructing Clash card is a 1/1, then three \(excessive\) damage “breaks through” and is dealt as an additional instance of clash damage to the defending Contender. If that Contender has a defense of 1, that Contender takes two clash damage, thus reducing that Contender’s health by two. 

117.4. A Clash card is considered defeated if its defense is reduced to zero by any means. Once an effect has resolved, resulting in the reduction of a Clash card’s defense to zero, that card is defeated and is put into its owner’s Oblivion \(after al Trigger – Defeat effects for that card have resolved\). This is a state-based action \(see rule 706\). 

117.4a. When a Clash card is defeated, if it had the Trigger – Defeat tag, that effect wil enter Standby and resolve per the rules of state triggers \(see rule 603.8\). 

117.5. If the source of the damage applied to a Clash card defeats it, that source is considered to have “defeated” the Clash card. 

117.6. If an effect triggers on damage being dealt by a specific source or sources, and the effect refers to the “damage dealt,” it refers only to the damage dealt by the specified sources and not to any damage dealt at the same time by other sources. 

117.7. Lethal damage is defined as a sufficient amount of damage to “defeat” a Clash card. 





118. Drawing a Card 

118.1. A player draws a card by putting the top card of their deck into their hand. This is done as a turn-based action during each player’s draw step. It may also be done as part of a cost or effect of a card or effect. 

118.2. Cards may only be drawn one at a time. If a player is instructed to draw multiple cards, that player performs that many individual card draws. 

118.2a. An instruction to draw multiple cards can be modified by replacement effects that refer to the number of cards drawn. This modification occurs before considering any of the individual card draws. 

118.2b. Some effects say that a player can’t draw more than one card each turn. Such an effect applies to individual card draws. Instructions to draw multiple cards may stil be partial y carried out. However, if an effect offers the player a choice to draw multiple cards, the affected player can’t choose to do so. Similarly, the player can’t pay a cost that includes drawing multiple cards. 

118.2c. If more than one player is instructed to draw cards, the active player performs al of their draws first, then each other player, in turn order, does the same. 

118.3. If there are no cards in a player’s deck and an effect offers that player the choice to draw a card, that player can choose to do so. However, if an effect says that a player can’t draw cards and another effect offers that player the choice to draw a card, that player can’t choose to do so. 

118.3a. The same principles apply if the player who’s making the choice is not the player who would draw the card. If the latter player has no cards in their deck, the choice can be taken. If an effect says that the latter player can’t draw a card, the choice can’t be taken. 

118.4. A player who attempts to draw a card from a deck with no cards in it loses the game. This is a state-based action \(see rule 706\). 

118.5. If an effect moves cards from a player’s deck to that player’s hand without using the word 

“draw,” the player has not drawn those cards. This makes a difference for effects that trigger on drawing cards and effects that replace card draws, as wel as if the player’s deck is empty. 

118.6. Some effects replace card draws. 

118.6a. An effect that replaces a card draw is applied even if no cards could be drawn because there are no cards in the affected player’s deck. 

118.6b. If an effect replaces a draw within a sequence of card draws, the replacement effect is completed before resuming the sequence. 

118.6c. Some effects perform additional actions on a card after it’s drawn. If the draw is replaced, the additional action is not performed on any cards that are drawn because of that replacement effect or any subsequent replacement effects. 

118.7. Some replacement effects and prevention effects result in one or more card draws. In such a case, if there are any parts of the original event that haven’t been replaced, those parts occur first, then the card draws happen one at a time. 

118.8. If an effect gives a player the option to reveal a card as they draw it, that player may look at that card as they draw it before choosing whether to reveal it. 

## 119. Counters 

119.1. A Counter is a marker placed on an object that modifies its characteristics and/or interacts with a rule, ability, or effect. Counters are not objects and have no characteristics. 

Notably, a Counter is not a token, and a token is not a Counter. Counters with the same name or description are interchangeable. Counters are typical y denoted and tracked with a d6. 

119.2. Counters are properly named with a specific identifying word or phrase. There are various types of Counters in the Alpha Clash Trading Card Game. 

119.2a. A Streak Counter is generated by cards that say so. Streak Counters do nothing and grant no effects unless a card or effect states they do. If that affect is no longer in play or active, then Streak Counters do nothing. 

119.3. If an effect says to “move” a Counter, it means to remove that Counter from the object it’s currently on and put it onto a second object. If either of these actions isn’t possible, it’s not possible to move a Counter, and no Counter is removed from or put onto anything. This may occur if the first and second objects are the same object; if the first object doesn’t have the appropriate kind of Counter on it; if the second object can’t have Counters put onto it; or if either object is no longer in the correct zone. 

119.4. Some cards and effects refer to Counters being put on an object. This refers to putting Counters on that object while it’s in play and to an object that’s given Counters as it enters play. 

119.4a. If an object enters play with Counters on it, the effect causing the object to be given Counters may specify which player puts those Counters on it. If the effect doesn’t specify a player, the object’s control er puts those Counters on it. 

119.5. An effect that triggers “When/Whenever the Nth \[kind\] Counter” is put on an object triggers when one or more Counters of the appropriate kind are put on the object such that the object had fewer than N Counters on it before the Counters were put on it and N or more Counters on it after. 



120. Ready / Engaged 

120.1. Any card in the upright position is considered “ready”. A card that is ready can’t be readied as part of a cost \(see rule 703.11\). 

120.2. Any card in the horizontal position is considered “engaged”. A card that is engaged can’t be engaged as part of a cost \(see rule 703.11\). 





2. Parts of a Card 

## 200. General 

200.1. The parts of a card are name, resource cost, specific resource cost, color, artwork, artist credit, type line, subtype line, character name, planet, affiliation, text box, attack and defense, rarity, legal text, and card identification. Some cards may have more than one of any or al of these parts. 

200.2. Some parts of a card are also characteristics of the object that has them \(see rule 109.3\). 

200.3. Some objects that aren’t cards \(tokens, copies of cards\) have some of the parts of a card, but only the ones that are also characteristics \(see rule 111 and rule 703.5\). 

## 201. Name 

201.1. The name of a card is printed in its upper left corner. 

201.2. A card’s name is always considered to be the English version of its name, regardless of printed language. 

201.2a. Two or more objects have the same name if they have at least one name in common, even if one or more of those objects have additional names. An object with no name doesn’t have the same name as any other object, including another object with no name. 

201.2b. Some cards and effects refer to two or more objects with different names. 

Those objects have different names only if each of them has at least one name and no two objects in that group have a name in common. 

201.2c. If a card or effect refers to a name in brackets, for example \[Moxie\], it can apply to any card with that character name \(see rule 205\). 

201.2d. If the ful name of a card is displayed in brackets, that card or effect only corresponds to that exactly named card. 

201.3. If an effect instructs a player to choose a card name, the player must choose the name of a card in the Clarified Card Reference \(see rule 108.1\). A player may not choose the name of a token unless it’s also the name of a card. 

201.4a. If a player is instructed to choose a card name with certain characteristics, the player must choose the name of a card whose Clarified text matches those characteristics \(see rule 108.1\). 

201.4. Text that refers to the object it’s on by name means just that object and not any other objects with that name, regardless of any name changes caused by game effects. 

## 202. Resource Cost and Color 

202.1. A card’s initial resource cost is indicated by the number within the colored hex near the top right of the card. 

202.1a. The initial resource cost of an object represents the total amount of resources needed to pay for that object. 

202.1b. Some objects have no initial resource cost. 

202.2. A card’s specific resource cost is indicated by the colored gems il ustrated below the initial resource cost along the right edge of a card \(see rule 107.4\). 

202.1a. The specific resource cost of an object indicates how many specific-colored resources must be included in paying the initial resource cost of that object. 

Example: \[Menacing Magnate\] has an initial resource cost of 2. Of that 2, one of those resources must be green, as indicated by the one green gem in the card’s specific resource cost. 

202.3. An object is the color or colors as indicated by the hex in the upper right corner of the object, the color of the gems in that object’s specific resource cost, the color indicated in that object’s attack and defense box, or the color as indicated in the object’s card identification in the lower right corner of the card. 

202.3a. The five colors are black, green, white, blue, and red. The resource symbols are represented as fol ows: \[⯁\] is black, \[⯁\] green, \[⯁\] white, \[⯁\] blue, and \[⯁\] red. 

202.3b. Effects may change an object’s color or give a color to an object \(see rule 105.3\). 

202.4. Any additional cost listed in an object’s card text or imposed by an effect isn’t part of the object’s resource cost \(see rule 601\). Such costs are paid at the same time as that object’s other costs. 

## 203. Artwork 

203.1. The artwork displayed on a card has no effect on game play. For example, a creature doesn’t have the Flight ability unless stated in its card text, even if it’s depicted as “flying”. 

203.2. The artist credit for a card fol ows the paintbrush icon displayed above the card’s text box. 

## 204. Type and Subtype Line 

204.1. The type and subtype line are printed at the very bottom of a card. It contains the card’s type\(s\) and the card’s subtype\(s\) as wel as any applicable character name, location name and planet. 

204.2. Card Types 

204.2a. The card types \(indicated at the bottom right of the card\) are Clash, Accessory, Action, and Clashground \(see Chapter 3\). Contender is another card type but is located at the top right corner of a card. 

204.2b. Tokens have card types even though they aren’t cards. The same is true of copies of cards. 

204.3. Subtypes 

204.3a. Accessory and Action cards can have one or more subtypes printed on its type line. 

204.3b. Subtypes of each card are shown in the bottom left of a card. 

204.3c. Accessories have a unique set of subtypes to include Traps and Weapons. 

204.3d. Actions have a unique set of subtypes to include Basic, Quick and Clash Buff. 

204.3e. An object can’t gain a subtype that doesn’t correspond to one of that object’s types. 

204.3f. If an effect instructs a player to choose a subtype, that player must choose one, and only one, existing subtype, and the subtype must be for the appropriate card type. 

## 205. Character Name 

205.1. The name in brackets in the lower left of a Contender or Clash card indicates the character name of that card. 

205.2. If an effect refers to a name in brackets that is found in the fol owing list, it refers to the character name of the card, not the actual name of the card.

- \[New York\] 

- \[San Francisco\] 



## 207. Planet 

207.1. The name in brackets in the lower left of a Contender, Clash card, or Clashground indicates the planet associated with that card. 

207.2. If an effect refers to a name in brackets that is found in the fol owing list, it refers to the planet of the card, not the actual name of the card. 

- \[Earth\] 

- \[Bardaga\] 

- \[Zenith Prime\] 

## 208. Affiliation 

208.1. The symbol in lower right of a Contender or Clash card indicates the affiliation that card belongs to. Affiliation is characteristic of a Contender or Clash card and is used to apply certain card effects or to meet various criteria for card effects. The affiliation of a Contender or Clash card is represented by a symbol \(see rule 107.4c\). 

208.1a. There are six affiliations in the Alpha Clash Trading Card Game: 

- Alpha 

- Alpha Hunter 

- Rogue 

- Discarded 

- Harbinger 

- Progenitor 





209. Rarity 

209.1. The color of the crystal at the bottom center of a card indicates the rarity of that card. 

209.1a. A white crystal indicates the card is common. 

209.1b. A green crystal indicates the card is uncommon. 

209.1c. A blue crystal indicates the card is rare. 

209.1d. A purple crystal indicates the card is epic. 

209.1d.1. A yel ow crystal indicates the card is iconic rare, which is an alternate art of an epic. An iconic art rare also has a yel ow crystal but has no relevant card information, thus iconic art rare cards are il egal in tournament play for the Alpha Clash Trading Card Game. 

209.1e. An orange crystal indicates the card is legendary. 

209.1e.1. A black crystal indicates the card is an alpha rare, which is an alternate art of a legendary. 

209.1f. A pink crystal indicates the card is either a promo or starter rare. 



209.2. Rarity has no effect on gameplay. 

## 210. Text Box 

210.1. The text box is printed on the lower half of the card. It usual y contains rules text defining the card’s effects and abilities. 

210.2. The text box may also contain italicized text that has no game function. 

210.2a. Reminder text is italicized text within parentheses that summarizes a rule that applies to that card. It usual y appears on the same line as the ability it’s relevant to, but it may appear on its own line if it applies to an aspect of the card other than an ability. 

210.2b. An ability keyword appears in bold and italics usual y at the top of a card’s text box. Ability keywords represent a predefined effect \(see rule 704\). Ability keywords include, Awe Factor X, Barrage X, Breakthrough, Close Combat, Enrage X, Exclusive, Flight, Interception, Irrefutable, Necrotic, Observant, Superspeed, Undisputed, and Unrivaled. 

211. Attack / Defense 

211.1. A Contender or a Clash card has two numbers displayed in its lower left corner. The first number is its attack power \(the amount of clash damage it deals in a Clash\); the second is its defense power \(the amount of damage needed to defeat it\). 

Example: 2/3 means the object has an attack power of 2 and defense power of 3. Attack and defense can be modified or set to particular values by effects. 

211.1a. Some effects refer to an object’s “initial attack power,” or “initial defense power,” This refers to the number listed on the card before any alterations to that value. 

211.1b. Some effects check an object’s “attack power” and/or “defense power”. These effects see the object’s characteristics after applying any continuous characteristic defining effects and alterations to that predefined value. 

Example: A Clash card with an attack/defense of 2/3 means the object has an “initial attack power” of 2 and an “initial defense power” of 3. Then an effect states, “target Clash card gets \+1/\+1 until end of turn.” This effect modifies the initial attack/defense of that Clash card, and it now has an “attack power” of 3 and a “defense power” of 4. 

211.2. If a Clash card’s defense power is reduced to zero by any means, that Clash card is considered “defeated” \(see rule 117.4\). 

211.3. If a Clash card somehow has no value for its attack power, its attack is considered to be 0. 

The same is true for defense power. 

212. Information Below the Text Box and Type Line 

212.1. Each card features text printed below the text box that has no effect on game play. 

212.2. A card’s identification is displayed in the bottom right of the card. 

Example: \[Piercing Strike\] has a card identification of AC1-117 \(UC\) Red. 

● “AC1” indicates that this card was released in Alpha Clash Set 1. 

● “117” indicates that this card is the 117th card printed in that set. 

● “\(UC\)” indicates the rarity of this card is Uncommon or UC for short. 

● “Red” indicates the color of that card is red. 

212.3 Legal text \(the fine print at the bottom-left of the card\) lists the trademark and copyright information for the Alpha Clash Trading Card Game produced by Rising Empire Studios LLC.

Contenders can have any of the fol owing characteristics: colors, abilities, card effects, an affiliation, attack/defense power, character name, planet, and a maximum health value. 

301.2. Contenders have a starting health listed in the top right corner of the card.

After resolving al effects, send the active Clashground to its owner’s Oblivion, then place the Clashground from Standby into its owner’s Clashground Zone. 

302.7. A player may not play a Clashground that has the same card name as a Clashground they control. However, a player may play a Clashground with the same name that an opponent controls. 

Example: Player A plays \[Amazon Rainforest\]. They control that Clashground. Player A can’t play another Clashground named \[Amazon Rainforest\]. However, Player B may play a Clashground named \[Amazon Rainforest\] since they do not control the active Clashground. 

302.8. Players may play over their own Clashground, so long as that Clashground has a different name. 

302.9. Clashgrounds have a specific location name and planet that correspond to various in-game effects.

4. Zones 

## 400. General 

400.1. A zone is a place where objects can be during a game. There are normal y nine zones: Contender Zone, Clash Zone, Clashground Zone, Accessory Zone, Resource Zone, Oblivion, Standby, hand, and deck. Each player has their own Contender Zone, Clash Zone, Clashground Zone, Accessory Zone, Resource Zone, Oblivion, hand, and deck. 

400.1a. Standby is a shared zone, shared by al players. 

400.2. Public zones are zones in which al players can see the cards’ faces, except for those cards that some rule or effect specifical y al ow to be face down \(e.g., Traps\). Contender, Clash Zone, Clashground Zone, Accessory Zone, Resource Zone, Oblivion and Standby are al public zones. 

Hidden zones are zones in which not al players can be expected to see the cards’ faces. Deck and hand are hidden zones, even if al the cards in one such zone happen to be revealed. 

400.3. If an object would go to any deck, Oblivion, or hand other than its owner’s, it goes to its owner’s corresponding zone. 

400.4. Cards with certain card types can only enter certain zones. 

400.4a. Clash cards can only enter play in the Clash Zone. 

400.4b. Clashgrounds can only enter play in the Clashground Zone. 

400.4c. Accessory cards can only enter play \(or be set\) in the Accessory Zone. 

400.5. The order of objects in a deck, or in Standby can’t be changed except when effects or rules al ow it. Other objects in other zones can be arranged however their owners choose, although who controls those objects, whether they’re engaged or upside down, and what other objects are attached to them must remain clear to al players. 

400.6. A known object that moves from a public zone to a player’s hand, deck, or Oblivion becomes a new object with no memory of, or relation to, its previous existence. 

400.6a. If an object moves from a public zone to a hidden zone and then returns to a public zone, that object is considered a new object. 

400.7. An object is outside the game if it isn’t in any of the game’s zones. Outside the game is not a zone. 

400.8. Cards in a player’s Sideboard are outside the game \(see rule 100.4\). 

400.8a. Cards outside the game can’t be affected by cards or effects. 

400.9. Some effects instruct a player to do something to a zone \(such as “Shuffle your hand into your deck”\). That action is performed on al cards in that zone. The zone itself is not affected. 

## 401. Deck 

401.1. At the start of each game, each player must present a deck 50 cards. 

401.2. Each deck must be kept in a single face-down pile. Players can’t look at or change the order of cards in a deck. 

401.3. Any player may count the number of cards remaining in any player’s deck at any time. 

401.4. If an effect puts two or more cards in a specific position in a deck at the same time, the owner of those cards may arrange them in any order. That deck’s owner doesn’t reveal the order in which the cards go into the deck. 

401.5. Some effects tel a player to play with the top card of their deck revealed or say that a player may look at the top card of their deck. If the top card of the player’s deck changes due to a card effect, the new top card won’t be revealed and can’t be looked at until that effect triggers and resolves again \(static effects are the exception\). The same is true with relation to an effect being activated. 

## 402. Hand 

402.1. The hand is where a player holds cards that have been drawn. Cards can be put into a player’s hand by other effects as wel . At the beginning of the game, each player draws a number of cards equal to that player’s starting hand size, normal y eight \(see rule 103\). 

402.2. Players have no maximum hand size. 

402.3. A player may arrange their hand in any convenient fashion and look at it at any time. A player can’t look at the cards in another player’s hand but may count those cards at any time. 

## 403. Oblivion 

403.1. A player’s Oblivion is their discard pile. Any object that's discarded, defeated, or “sent to Oblivion” is put on top of its owner’s Oblivion, as is any Action card that’s finished resolving. 

Each player’s Oblivion starts the game empty. 

403.2. Each Oblivion is kept in a single face-up pile. A player can examine the cards in any Oblivion at any time and the order of the cards in a player’s Oblivion does not matter. 

403.3. If an effect or rule puts two or more cards into the same Oblivion at the same time, the owner of those cards may arrange them in any order. 

## 404. Contender Zone 

404.1. Only Contender cards can be in this zone. 

404.2. Players begin the game with their chosen Contender in this zone. 

## 405. Clashground Zone 

405.1. Only Clashground cards can be in this zone. 

405.2. When a player plays \(and resolves\) a Clashground card, send al active cards in al Clashground Zones to Oblivion. 

405.3. Clashgrounds enter this zone in the ready position. 

406. Clash Zone 

406.1. Only Clash cards and Weapons attached to Clash cards can be in this zone. 

406.2. Clash cards enter this zone in the ready position. 

## 407. Accessory Zone 

407.1. Only Accessories can be in this zone. 

407.2. Traps are set into this zone face down. 

407.3. Weapons can be moved from this zone to the Clash Zone when their attached cost has been paid. 

407.4. When a Clash card, with one or more attached Weapons, leaves play, al of their attached Weapons return to this zone in the state in which they were in \(either engaged or ready\). 

## 408. Resource Zone 

408.1. In your Expansion Phase, during your resource step, you may put up to one card from your hand into your Resource Zone. You must decide whether to put a card into your Resource Zone in this step. You can’t put a resource into your Resource Zone during your Primary Phase, unless otherwise stated. 

408.2. Cards are put in the Resource Zone ready and in the upside-down \(or inverted\) position. 

408.3. Cards in the Resource Zone do not enter play but are considered to be in play. 

408.4. Cards in the Resource Zone are considered blank except for their color. 



408.4a. The have no effects or characteristics except for their color. 

408.5. You pay resources to play cards and activate effects. 

408.6. Cards in the Resource Zone can be engaged to generate one resource of that card’s color. 

408.7. You may engage a card in your Resource Zone to generate resources if the game state requires you to pay for a card or effect. 

408.7a. Resources may only be generated if the game state requires you to do so. In other words, you may not engage a card in your Resource Zone for no reason. 

408.8. To impact the game state, you must fol ow these steps: a\) Declare a card to play or an effect to activate by placing it into Standby. 

b\) Generate resources for that card/effect. 

c\) Pay the corresponding resources for that card/effect. 

d\) Once al opponents have had priority to respond to the card/effect in Standby, resolve that card/effect. 





409. Standby 

405.1. When a card is played, the physical card is put into Standby \(see rule 601.1a\). When an effect is activated or triggers, that effect goes into Standby without any card associated with it \(see rules 602.2a and 603.2\). 

405.2. Standby keeps track of the order that cards and/or effects were added to it. Each time an object is put into Standby, it’s put on top of al objects already there. 

405.3. If an effect puts two or more objects into Standby at the same time, those control ed by the active player are put on lowest, fol owed by each other player’s objects in APNAP order \(see rule 101.4\). If a player controls more than one of these objects, that player chooses their relative order in Standby. 

405.4. Cards do not have abilities in Standby. 

405.5. When al players pass priority in succession, the top \(last-added\) card or effect in Standby resolves. 

405.6. Some things that happen during the game don’t go into Standby. 

405.6a. Static effects continuously generate their effects and don’t go into Standby \(see rule 604\). 

405.6b. Engaging a resource does not go into Standby. 

405.6c. Turn-based actions don’t go into Standby; they happen automatical y when certain steps or phases begin. They’re dealt with before a player would receive priority \(see rule 114\). Turn based actions also happen automatical y when each step and phase ends; no player receives priority afterward \(see rule 705\). 

405.6d. State-based actions don’t go into Standby; they happen automatical y when certain conditions are met \(see rule 706\). They are dealt with before a player would receive priority \(see rule 114\). 

405.6e. A player may concede the game at any time. That player leaves the game immediately. This action does not go into Standby \(see rule 104.3a\). 





5. Turn Structure 

## 500. General 

500.1. A turn consists of four phases, proceeding in this order: Start of Turn Phase, Expansion Phase, Primary Phase and End of Turn Phase. Note: An additional fifth phase, named the Clash Phase, is an embedded phase within a player’s Primary Phase. The active player \(and the defending player\) enters this phase when an attack is declared and then play returns to the active player’s Primary Phase when the steps of that Clash are completed. The Expansion Phase and Clash Phase are broken down into steps, which proceed in order. 

500.2. Players general y have priority in their own phases. However, priority can be passed back and forth between players as cards are played, effects are activated, attacks are declared etc. 

\(see rule 114\). 

500.3. When a phase or step ends, any effects scheduled to last “until end of” that phase or step expire. When a phase or step begins, any effects scheduled to last “until” that phase or step expire. Effects that last “until end of the clash” expire at the end of the clash phase that effect corresponds to. Effects that last “until end of turn” are subject to special rules \(see rule 505\). 

500.4. When a phase or step begins, any abilities that trigger “at the beginning of” that phase or step wil trigger and be put into Standby. The owner of that effect gains priority to resolve that effect \(see rule 114\). 

500.5. No game events can occur between turns, phases, or steps. 

## 501. Start of Turn Phase 

501.1. Any effects that trigger at “start of turn” \(or similar phrasing\) wil trigger and resolve here. The owner of the triggered effect gains priority to resolve their effect. Priority is then returned to the active player. 

## 502. Expansion Phase 

502.1. The Expansion Phase consists of the fol owing three steps: Ready Step, Draw Step, and Resource Step. The player going first in a game skips their first Ready and Draw Step. 

502.1a. Ready Step - The active player readies \(turn to the vertical position\) al cards they control. Normal y, al of a player’s permanents wil be readied, but effects can keep one or more of a player’s permanents engaged. This turn-based action doesn’t use Standby. 

502.1b. Draw Step - The active player draws one card from the top of their deck. This turn-based action doesn’t use Standby. 

502.1c. Resource Step - The active player may put up to one card from their hand into their Resource Zone. A player may skip this action. Also, a player is not al owed to place a card into their Resource Zone outside of this step unless otherwise stated by a card effect. This turn-based action doesn’t use Standby. 

502.2. Any effect that triggers during these steps wil be placed into Standby. The owner of the triggered effect gains priority to resolve their effect. Priority is then returned to the active player. 

## 503. Primary Phase 

503.1. A player may do any of the fol owing actions in any order during their Primary Phase: 503.1a. The active player may play Clash cards, Clashgrounds, and/or non-Trap Accessories from their hand into that card’s corresponding game zone. Non-Trap Accessories currently include Weapons. 

503.1b. The active player may play Basic Actions during this phase. Basic Actions can only be played during a player’s own Primary Phase. 

503.1c. The active player may set any number of Traps from their hand face down into their Accessory Zone. “Setting” a Trap is not considered “playing” a Trap. Setting a Trap requires no resource cost to do so. 

503.1d. The active player may initiate a Clash. The active player \(and the defending player\) are in the Clash Phase as soon as the active player declares an attack \(see rule 504.2\). 

503.1e. The active player may end their turn during this phase. Play then passes to the next player in turn order \(usual y the player to the left\). 

## 504. Clash Phase 

504.1. During the Clash Phase, the active player is the attacking player; Clash cards that player controls may be declared as attackers. During the Clash Phase of a two-player game, the nonactive player is the defending player; that player’s Contender and their engaged Clash cards may be attacked. 

504.2. Clashes occur one at a time and fol ow these six steps in order: Attack Step, Counter Step, Obstruct Step, Attacker’s Clash Buff Step, Defender’s Clash Buff Step, and Damage Step. 

504.2a. C1: Attack Step – The attacking player has priority. The attacking player chooses one Contender or Clash card they control and engages it to declare an attack targeted at an opponent’s Contender or an opponent’s engaged Clash card. Engaging a Contender or Clash card when it’s declared as an attacker isn’t a cost; attacking simply causes Clash cards to become engaged \(this is a turn-based action\). Note: A player must declare a target of their attack in this step. Then the attacking player resolves any Trigger - Attack effects \(or any other attack-based triggered effects\) of the attacking Clash card. Once those effects have resolved, priority passes to the defending player’s Counter Step \(C2\). 

504.2b. C2: Counter Step – The defending player has priority. The defending player may play or activate any number of Quick Actions, Traps, or card effects with the Counter - 

Attack trigger tag, one at a time. 

Example: Player A declares an attack with their 6/6 Clash card targeted at Player B’s Contender. In the Counter Step, Player B activates \[Better Luck Next Time\!\]. Player A has no response, and the effect of \[Better Luck Next Time\!\] resolves giving the 6/6 Clash card 

-3/-3, thus making it a 3/3. Then priority is returned to the defending player, and they choose to activate another \[Better Luck Next Time\!\]. The Trap’s effect resolves, thus making the 3/3 attacking Clash card a 0/0. That Clash card is considered to be 

“defeated” and the Clash Phase ends. 

504.2b.1. When al of the defending player’s desired effects have resolved, they move to the Obstruct Step \(C3\). 

504.2c. C3: Obstruct Step – The defending player has priority. The defending player may obstruct with one or more of their ready Clash cards. When obstructors are declared, the attacking Contender or Clash card is now attacking the obstructors, not the original target of the attack. Any effect that triggers when Clash cards are declared as obstructors wil trigger in this step. Triggered effects that trigger on obstructors being declared may have different trigger conditions. 

504.2c.1. When the defending player has completed declaring al of their obstructors, play then passes to the Attacker’s Clash Buff Step \(C4\). 

504.2d. C4: Attacker’s Clash Buff Step – The attacking player has priority. The attacking player may play one Clash Buff Action. That Clash Buff does not need to target the attacking Contender or Clash card. 

504.2e. C5: Defender’s Clash Buff Step – The defending player has priority. The defending player may play one Clash Buff Action. That Clash Buff does not need to target the defending Contender or Clash card. 

504.2f. C6: Damage Step – The attacking player has priority. Clash damage is then totaled and dealt simultaneously. Al cards involved in the clash wil be involved in clash damage. The total attack power of the attacker is dealt as clash damage to the defending Contender or defending Clash cards \(or each Clash card that is obstructing the attacker\). While at the same time, the total attack power of the defending Contender or defending Clash cards \(or any obstructors\) is dealt as clash damage to the attacker. 

Clash damage reduces the Contender or Clash card’s defense power by that amount. If the damage dealt to a Contender reduces its defense power to zero, al excess damage reduces that Contender’s health by that amount. If the damage dealt to a Clash card reduces its defense power to zero \(or less\), that Clash card is defeated, and is put into its owner’s Oblivion \(after al Trigger – Defeat effects for that card have resolved\). This is a state-based action. Trigger - Defeat effects of the defeated Clash card trigger per the rules of state triggers. If the damage dealt to a Clash card does not reduce its defense power to zero \(or less\), that card remains in play and its defense power wil be reset to its pre-Clash amount after that Clash. Regardless of the amount of damage dealt, a Contender wil remain in play and its defense power wil be reset to its pre-Clash amount after the Clash. Any effect that triggers on clash damage being dealt wil trigger in this step. The owner of the triggered effect gains priority to resolve their effect. 

Priority is then returned to the active player. Triggered effects that trigger on clash damage being dealt may have different trigger conditions. 

Note: A card effect that “sends a Clash card to Oblivion” is not the same as being 

“defeated” since that Clash card’s defense was never reduced to zero. Also, when a Clash card is defeated, it is put into Oblivion, not sent to Oblivion. 

504.3. If at any time the attacking Clash card is defeated or leaves play, the Clash Phase ends and play returns to the active player’s Primary Phase. 

504.4. If at any time the target of an attack is defeated or leaves play due to a card effect, the attacker continues to be an attacking Clash card, however, it is attacking neither a Contender nor a Clash card and wil thus deal no clash damage. Then, the Clash Phase ends and play returns to the active player’s Primary Phase. There is one exception to his rule \(see rule 504.4a\). 

504.4a. If the attacking Clash card has the Breakthrough ability and the target of their attack leaves play due to a card effect, excessive clash damage is stil dealt to the defending Contender. In other words, if the attacking Clash card with Breakthrough is obstructed and that obstructor is removed from the Clash by a card effect the total defense power of al opposing Clash cards is considered to be 0 \(see rule 704.4d\). 

504.5. An attacker is removed from a Clash if it leaves play, if its control er changes, or if an effect specifical y removes it from the Clash. A Contender or Clash card that’s removed from a Clash stops being an attacking, obstructing, obstructed, and/or unobstructed Contender or Clash card. 

504.6. Readying or engaging a Clash card that’s already been declared as an attacker or obstructor doesn’t remove it from the Clash and doesn’t prevent it from dealing or being dealt clash damage. 

504.7. Any effects \(not denoted by a Trigger - Attack trigger tag\) that trigger on attackers being declared wil trigger. Effects that trigger on a Contender or Clash card attacking, trigger only at the point the Contender or Clash card is declared as an attacker. They wil not trigger if a Contender or Clash card attacks and then that Contender or Clash card’s characteristics change to match the effect’s trigger condition. The owner of the triggered effect gains priority to resolve their effect. Priority is then returned to the active player. 

Example: The active Clashground has the effect “Whenever a green Clash card attacks, send that Clash card to Oblivion after this Clash.” If a blue Clash card attacks and is later turned green by another card effect, the “send to Oblivion” effect wil not trigger. 

504.8. An effect that reads “Whenever a Contender or Clash card attacks and isn’t obstructed, 

...” triggers during the Obstruct Step, not the Attack Step. 

504.9. The defending player checks each Clash card they control to see whether it’s affected by any restrictions \(effects that say it can’t obstruct, or that it can’t obstruct unless some condition is met\). If any restrictions are being disobeyed, the declaration of obstructors is il egal. A restriction may be created by an evasive ability \(a keyword ability an attacking Clash card has 

that restricts what can obstruct it, such as Flight\). If an attacking Clash card gains or loses an evasive ability after a legal obstruction has been declared, it doesn’t affect that obstruction. 

504.10. Effects that last “until end of this clash” expire at the end of the Clash Phase in which that effect triggered. Effects that trigger “after this clash” trigger when the active player returns to their Primary Phase after the Clash Phase in which the effect was triggered. The owner of the triggered effect gains priority to resolve their effect. Priority is then returned to the active player. 

## 505. End of Turn Phase 

505.1. A player enters the End of Turn Phase by declaring, during their own Primary Phase, that they are “ending their turn” or any other phrasing that indicates that they are passing priority to the next player in turn order. 

505.2. Any effects that trigger at “end of turn” \(or similar phrasing\) wil trigger and resolve here. 

The owner of the triggered effect gains priority to resolve their effect. Priority is then returned to the active player. 

505.3. Effects that last “until end of turn” expire at the end of the active player’s turn in which that effect triggered. 

505.4. Non-clash damage is removed from any undefeated Clash cards. 

505.5. If there is a card or an effect in Standby, a turn can’t end, and play can’t be passed to the next player in turn order. 





6. Cards and Effects 

600. General 

## 601. Playing Cards 

601.1. To play a card is to take it from where it is \(usual y the hand\), pay its costs, and then put it into Standby, so that it wil eventual y resolve and have its effect. Playing a card includes the proposal of the card \(rules 601.1a–d\) and determination and payment of resource costs and any additional costs \(rules 601.1f\). To play a card, a player fol ows the steps listed below, in order. A player must be legal y al owed to play the card to begin this process \(see rule 601.1e\). If a player is unable to comply with the requirements of a step listed below while performing that step, the playing of the card is il egal; the game returns to the moment before the playing of that card was proposed \(see rule 708\). 

601.1a. To propose the playing of a card, a player first moves that card from where it is to Standby. It becomes the topmost object in Standby. It has al the characteristics of the card associated with it, and that player becomes its control er. The card remains in Standby until it resolves, it’s negated, or a rule or effect moves it elsewhere. 

601.1b. If the card has a modal effect, the player declares the mode choice \(see rule 702\). If the card has alternative or additional costs that wil be paid as it’s being played, the player declares their intentions to pay any or al of those costs. A player can’t apply two alternative methods of playing or two alternative costs to a single card. If the card has a variable cost that wil be paid as it’s being played \(such as an \{X\} in its resource cost; see rule 107.3\), the player declares the value of that variable. If the value of that variable is defined in the text of the card by a choice that player would make later in the declaration or resolution of the card, that player makes that choice at this time instead of that later time. 

601.1c. The player declares their choice of an appropriate object or player for each target the card requires. If the card has a variable number of targets, the player declares how many targets they wil choose before they declare those targets. In some cases, the number of targets wil be defined by the card’s text. Once the number of targets the card has is determined, that number doesn’t change, even if the information used to determine the number of targets does. The same target can’t be chosen multiple times for any one instance of the word “target” on the card. However, if the card uses the word “target” in multiple places, the same object or player can be chosen once for each instance of the word “target” \(as long as it fits the targeting criteria\). If any effects say that an object or player must be chosen as a target, the player chooses targets so that they obey the maximum possible number of such effects without violating any rules or effects that say that an object or player can’t be chosen as a target. The chosen objects and/or players each become a target of that card. \(Any effects that trigger when those objects and/or players become the target of a card trigger at this point; they’l wait to be put into Standby until the card has finished being played.\) 

601.1d. If the card \(or effect\) requires the player to divide or distribute an effect \(such as damage or Counters\) among one or more targets, the player declares the division. 

Each of these targets must receive at least one of whatever is being divided. 

Example: The Barrage ability of \[Machina, Unstoppable Force\] al ows you to deal \(six\) damage divided as you choose, amongst up to two target Clash cards. Each of these targets must receive at least one of the damage being divided. Therefore, you can deal 1 

and 5 damage, 2 and 4 damage, or 3 and 3 damage. 

601.1e. The game state checks to see if the proposed card can legal y be played. If the proposed card is il egal, the game returns to the moment before the playing of that card was proposed \(see rule 708 and rule 704.7\). 

601.1f. The player determines the total cost of the card. Usual y this is just the resource cost. Some cards have additional or alternative costs. Some effects may increase or reduce the cost to pay or may provide other alternative costs. Costs may include paying resources, engaging permanents, sending permanents to Oblivion, discarding cards, and so on. The total cost is the resource cost or alternative cost \(as determined in rule 601.1b\), plus al additional costs and cost increases, and minus al cost reductions. If multiple cost reductions apply, the player may apply them in any order. If the specific resource component of the total cost is reduced to nothing by cost reduction effects, it is considered to be \{0\}. It can’t be reduced to less than \{0\}. Once the total cost is determined, any effects that directly affect the total cost are applied. Then the resulting total cost becomes the “final cost” of that card. If effects would change the total cost after this time, they have no effect. 

601.1g. Once the steps described in 601.1a–f are completed, effects that modify the characteristics of the card as it’s played are applied, then the card becomes played. Any effects that trigger when a card is played trigger at this time. The card’s control er then passes priority to the other players \(in turn order\) to respond with any Counter - Play cards and/or effects. 

601.2. Some cards specify that one of their control er’s opponents does something the control er would normal y do while it’s being played, such as choose a mode or choose targets. 

In these cases, the opponent does so when the card’s control er normal y would do so. 

601.2a. If there is more than one opponent who could make such a choice, the card’s control er decides which of those opponents wil make the choice. 

601.2b. If the card instructs its control er and another player to do something at the same time as the card is being played, the card’s control er goes first, then the other player. This is an exception to rule 101.4. 

601.3. Playing a card that alters costs won’t affect cards and effects that are already in Standby. 

## 602. Activated Effects 

602.1. Activated effects have an “activation cost” and a “resulting effect”. 

602.1a. The activation cost is denoted in the text of the card, usual y before the sentence beginning with, “If you do.. ”. The resulting effect is usual y contained in the sentence beginning with “If you do…”. 

Example: \[Flare\] states, “Once per turn, during your Primary Phase, you may engage this card. If you do, deal one damage to target Clash card or Contender.” Engaging \[Flare\] is the activation cost and dealing one damage to a target Clash card or Contender is the resulting effect. 

602.2. To activate an effect is to put it into Standby and pay its costs, so that it wil eventual y resolve and have its effect. Only an object’s control er \(or its owner if it doesn’t have a control er\) can activate its activated effect unless the object specifical y says otherwise. 

Activating an effect fol ows the steps listed below, in order. If, at any point during the activation of an effect, a player is unable to comply with any of those steps, the activation is il egal; the game returns to the moment before that effect started to be activated \(see rule 708\). 

Declarations and payments can’t be altered after they’ve been made. 

602.2a. The player declares that they are activating the effect. If an activated effect is being activated from a hidden zone, the card that has that effect is revealed. That effect is put into Standby as an object that’s not a card. It becomes the topmost object in Standby. It has the text of the effect that created it, and no other characteristics. Its control er is the player who activated the effect. The effect remains in Standby until it’s negated, it resolves, or another effect moves it elsewhere. 

602.2b. The remainder of the process for activating an effect is identical to the process for playing a card listed in rules 601.1b–f. Those rules apply to activating an effect just as they apply to the playing of a card. An activated effect analog to a card’s resource cost \(as referenced in rule 601.1f\) is its activation cost. 

602.3. Some effects specify that one of their control er’s opponents does something the control er would normal y do while it’s being activated, such as choose a mode or choose targets. In these cases, the opponent does so when the effect’s control er normal y would do so. 

602.3a. If there is more than one opponent who could make such a choice, the effect’s control er decides which of those opponents wil make the choice. 

602.3b. If the effect instructs its control er and another player to do something at the same time as the effect is being activated, the effect’s control er goes first, then the other player. This is an exception to rule 101.4. 

602.4. Activating an effect that alters costs won’t affect cards and effects that are already in Standby. 

602.5. Some activated effects exist on permanents that have a trigger tag. They obey the same timing rules as outlined below and in rule 304.8. In order to activate a “Counter -“ effect of a permanent, that player must declare the activation of the effect so long as the trigger tag and timing rules are obeyed. That effect enters Standby and fol ows normal effect resolution rules \(see rule 605\). 

● Counter - Attack: Activate this effect in response to an opponent attacking you. 

● Counter - Play: Activate this effect in response to an opponent playing a card. 

● Counter - Trap: Activate this effect in response to an opponent activating a Trap. 

602.6. Some card effects can be used once per turn and have no activation cost associated. 

These are cal declaration effects. A player may put this effect into Standby by declaring that they are doing so, so long as the timing and conditions of the effect declaration on the card are obeyed. After declaration, that effect enters Standby and fol ows normal effect resolution rules \(see rule 605\). 

## 603. Triggered Effects 

603.1. Triggered effects have a trigger condition and a resulting effect. They are written as 

“\[When/Whenever/At\] \[trigger condition or event\], \[resulting effect\].” 

603.1a. A triggered effect may include instructions after its effects that limit what the effect may target. This text is not part of the effect. It functions while the effect is in Standby. 

603.1b. There are certain trigger tags that indicate a particular trigger event. The fol owing trigger tags may appear on cards and they mean the fol owing... 

● Trigger - Attack: When this card attacks… 

● Trigger - Enter: When this card enters play… 

● Trigger - Defeat: When this card is defeated… 

603.2. Whenever a game event or game state matches a triggered effect’s trigger event, that effect automatical y triggers and enters Standby \(see rule 603.1b\). 

603.2a. Because they aren’t played or activated, triggered effects can trigger even when it isn’t legal to play cards and activate effects. Effects that preclude effects from being activated don’t affect them. 

603.2b. When a phase or step begins, al effects that trigger “at the beginning of” that phase or step wil trigger. 

603.2c. An effect triggers only once each time its trigger event occurs. However, it can trigger repeatedly if one event contains multiple occurrences unless otherwise stated. 

Example: A permanent has an effect whose trigger condition reads, “Whenever you discard a card, this Clash card gets \+1/\+1 until end of turn.” If someone plays a card that makes you discard your hand, the effect wil trigger once for each card put into your Oblivion from your hand as a result of that card’s effect resolution. 

603.2d. An effect may state that a triggered effect triggers additional times. In this case, rather than simply determining that such an effect has triggered, determine how many times it should trigger, then that effect triggers that many times. An effect that states that an effect triggers additional times doesn’t invoke itself repeatedly and doesn’t apply to other effects that affect how many times an effect triggers. 

603.2e. Some effects refer to a triggered effect of an object. Such effects refer only to triggered effects the object has, not any delayed triggered effects \(see rule 603.7\) that may be created by effects the object has. 

603.2f. Some trigger events use the word “becomes” \(for example, “becomes attached” 

or “becomes obstructed”\). These trigger only at the time the named event happens \(they don’t trigger if that state already exists or retrigger if it persists\). An effect that triggers when a permanent “becomes engaged” or “becomes ready” doesn’t trigger if the permanent enters play in that state. 

Example: An effect that triggers when a permanent “becomes engaged” triggers only when the status of a permanent that’s already in play changes from ready to engaged. 

603.2g. If a triggered effect’s trigger condition is met, but the object with that triggered effect is at no time visible to al players, the effect does not trigger. 

603.2h. An effect triggers only if its trigger event actual y occurs. An event that’s prevented or replaced won’t trigger anything. 

Example: An effect that triggers on damage being dealt won’t trigger if al the damage is prevented. 

603.2i. A triggered effect may have limitations such as, “This effect triggers only once per turn.” The effect triggers only if its source’s control er has not yet met the limited effect’s trigger condition. 

603.3. Once an effect has triggered, its control er receives priority and puts the triggered effect into Standby as an object that’s not a card. The effect becomes the topmost object in Standby. It has the text of the effect that created it, and no other characteristics. It remains in Standby until it’s negated, it resolves, a rule causes it to be removed from Standby, or an effect moves it elsewhere. 

603.3a. A triggered effect is control ed by the player who control ed its source at the time it triggered unless it’s a delayed triggered effect. To determine the control er of a delayed triggered effect, see rules 603.7. 

603.3b. If multiple effects have triggered since the last time a player received priority, the effects are placed into Standby in a two-part process. First, each player, in APNAP 

order, puts each triggered effect they control with a trigger condition that isn’t another effect triggering into Standby in any order they choose \(see rule 101.4.\). Second, each player, in APNAP order, puts al remaining triggered effects they control into Standby in any order they choose. Then the game once again checks for and performs state-based actions \(such as “being defeated”\) until none are performed, then effects that triggered during this process go into Standby. This process repeats until no new state-based actions are performed and no effects trigger. Then the appropriate player gets priority. 

603.3c. If a triggered effect is modal, its control er declares the mode choice when putting the effect into Standby. If one of the modes would be il egal \(due to an inability 

to choose legal targets, for example\), that mode can’t be chosen. If no mode is chosen, the effect is removed from Standby \(see rule 702\). 

603.3d. The remainder of the process for putting a triggered effect into Standby is identical to the process for playing a card listed in rules 601.1c–d. If a choice is required when the triggered effect goes into Standby, but no legal choices can be made for it, or if a rule or a continuous effect otherwise makes the effect il egal, the effect is simply removed from Standby. 

603.4. A triggered effect may read “When/Whenever/At \[trigger event\], if \[condition\], \[effect\].” 

When the trigger event occurs, the effect checks whether the stated condition is true. The effect triggers only if it is true, otherwise, it does nothing. If the effect triggers, it checks the stated condition again as it resolves. If the condition isn’t true at that time, the effect is removed from Standby and does nothing. 

603.5. Some triggered effects are optional \(they contain “may,” as in “Trigger – Enter: You may draw one card”\). These effects go into Standby when they trigger, regardless of whether their control er intends to exercise the effect’s option or not. The choice is made when the effect resolves. Likewise, triggered effects wil go into Standby normal y. The “unless” part of the effect is dealt with when the effect resolves. 

603.6. Trigger events that involve objects changing zones are cal ed “zone-change triggers.” 

Many effects with zone-change triggers attempt to do something to that object after it changes zones. During resolution, these effects look for the object in the zone that it moved to. If the object is unable to be found in the zone it went to, the part of the effect attempting to do something to the object wil fail to do anything. The effect could be unable to find the object because the object never entered the specified zone, because it left the zone before the effect resolved, or because it is in a zone that is hidden from a player, such as a deck or an opponent’s hand. \(This rule applies even if the object leaves the zone and returns again before the effect resolves.\) The most common zone-change trigger is an effect with the Trigger – Enter tag. 

603.6a. Trigger - Enter effects trigger when a permanent enters play. These are usual y written as, “Trigger - Enter: You may draw one card.” 

603.6b. Continuous effects or additional effects that modify characteristics of a permanent do so the moment the permanent is in play \(and not before then\). 

Continuous effects don’t apply before the permanent is in play, however \(see rule 603.6d\). 

Example: \[Energy Blast\] reads, “...When that \[Clash\] card enters play, deal two damage to that card.” When the Clash card being played enters play from Standby, it is immediately dealt two damage as if it had the effect, "Trigger - Enter: Deal two damage to this Clash card." 

603.6c. Leaves play effects trigger when a permanent moves from “in-play” to another zone. These are written as, but aren’t limited to, “When \[this object\] leaves play…” or 

“Whenever \[something\] is put into Oblivion from the Clash Zone…”. An effect that attempts to do something to the card that left play checks for it only in the first zone 

that it went to. An effect that triggers when a card is put into a certain zone “from anywhere” is never treated as a leaves play ability, even if an object is put into that zone from play. 

603.6d. Some permanents have text that reads “\[This permanent\] enters play engaged” 

Such text is a static effect \(not a triggered effect\) whose effect occurs as part of the event that puts the permanent into play. 

603.7. An effect may create a delayed triggered effect that can do something at a later time. A delayed triggered effect wil contain “when,” “whenever,” or “at,” although that word won’t usual y begin the effect. 

603.7a. Delayed triggered effects are created during the resolution of cards or effects, as the result of a replacement effect being applied, or as a result of a static effect that al ows a player to take an action. A delayed triggered effect won’t trigger until it has actual y been created, even if its trigger event occurred just beforehand. Other events that happen earlier may make the trigger event impossible. 

603.7b. A delayed triggered effect wil trigger only once \(the next time its trigger event occurs\) unless it has a stated duration, such as “this turn.” If its trigger event occurs more than once simultaneously and the effect doesn’t have a stated duration, the control er of the delayed triggered effect chooses which event causes the effect to trigger. 

603.7c. A delayed triggered effect that refers to a particular object stil affects it even if the object changes characteristics. However, if that object is no longer in the zone it’s expected to be in at the time the delayed triggered effect resolves, the effect won’t affect it. 

603.7d. If a card creates a delayed triggered effect, the source of that delayed triggered effect is that card. The control er of that delayed triggered effect is the player who control ed that card as it resolved. 

603.7e. If an activated or triggered effect creates a delayed triggered effect, the source of that delayed triggered effect is the same as the source of that other effect. The control er of that delayed triggered effect is the player who control ed that other effect as it resolved. 

603.7f. If a static effect generates a replacement effect which causes a delayed triggered effect to be created, the source of that delayed triggered effect is the object with that static effect. The control er of that delayed triggered effect is the same as the control er of that object at the time the replacement effect was applied. 

603.7g. If a static effect al ows a player to take an action and creates a delayed triggered effect if that player does so, the source of that delayed triggered effect is the object with that static effect. The control er of that delayed triggered effect is the same as the control er of that object at the time the action was taken. 

Example: You play \[Moxie, Alpha Hunting Specialist\]. The Trigger – Enter effect of 

\[Moxie, Alpha Hunting Specialist\] reveals three cards: \[Surprise\!\], \[Moxie’s Sidearm\], and 

\[Colonel Edwards\]. You choose \[Colonel Edwards\] from among the revealed cards and put him into your Clash Zone engaged. The Trigger - Enter effect of \[Colonel Edwards\] 

triggers, however, that trigger is delayed until the active effect has been ful y resolved. 

So, you wil put \[Surprise\!\] and \[Moxie’s Sidearm\] into your Oblivion -- as part of the effect resolution of \[Moxie, Alpha Hunting Specialist\] – then the effect of Colonel Edwards is resolved as part of the delayed triggered resolution. 

603.8. Some triggered effects trigger when a game state \(such as a player control ing no permanents of a particular card type\) is true, rather than triggering when an event occurs. These effects trigger as soon as the game state matches the condition. They’l go into Standby at the next available opportunity. These are cal ed state triggers. \(Note that state triggers aren’t the same as state-based actions.\) A state-triggered effect doesn’t trigger again until the effect has resolved, has been negated, or has otherwise left Standby. Then, if the object with the effect is stil in the same zone and the game state stil matches its trigger condition, the effect wil trigger again. The most common state trigger is Trigger – Defeat. 

Example: A permanent’s effect reads, “Whenever you have no cards in hand, draw one card.” If its control er plays the last card from their hand, the effect wil trigger once and won’t trigger again until it has left Standby. If its control er plays a card that reads “Discard your hand, then draw that many cards,” the effect wil trigger during the card’s resolution because the player’s hand was momentarily empty. 

603.9. Normal y, objects that exist immediately after an event are checked to see if the event matched any trigger conditions, and continuous effects that exist at that time are used to determine what the trigger conditions are and what the objects involved in the event look like. 

However, some triggered effects are exceptions to this rule; the game “looks back in time” to determine if those effects trigger, using the existence of those effects and the appearance of objects immediately prior to the event. The list of exceptions is as fol ows: 603.9a. Some zone-change triggers look back in time. These are leaves play effects, effects that trigger when a card leaves a player’s Oblivion, and effects that trigger when an object that al players can see is put into a hand or deck. 

Example: Two Clash cards are in play along with a Weapon that has the effect, 

“Whenever a Clash card leaves play, your Contender gains one health.” Someone plays a card that sends al Clash cards and Weapons to Oblivion. The Weapon’s effect triggers twice, even though the Weapon goes to its owner’s Oblivion at the same time as the Clash cards. 

603.9b. Effects that trigger specifical y when an object becomes unattached look back in time. 

603.9c. Effects that trigger when a player loses control of an object look back in time. 

603.9d. Effects that trigger when a card/or an attack is negated look back in time. 

604. Static Effects 

604.1. Static effects do something al the time rather than being activated or triggered. They are written as statements, and they’re simply true. 

604.2. Static effects are continuous effects, some of which are prevention effects or replacement effects. These effects are active as long as the permanent with the effect remains in play and has the effect, or as long as the object with the effect remains in the appropriate zone. 

604.3. Some static effects are characteristic defining effects. A characteristic defining effect conveys information about an object’s characteristics that would normal y be found elsewhere on that object \(such as in its resource cost, type, or attack/defense value\). Characteristic defining effects can add to or override information found elsewhere on that object. 

Characteristic defining effects function in al zones. They also function outside the game and before the game begins. 

604.3a. A static effect is a characteristic defining effect if it meets the fol owing criteria: 1\) It defines an object’s colors, types/subtypes, attack, or defense, health; 2\) it is printed on the card it affects, it was granted to the token it affects by the effect that created the token, or it was acquired by the object it affects as the result of a copy effect or text-changing effect; 3\) it does not directly affect the characteristics of any other objects; 4\) it is not an effect that an object grants to itself; and 5\) it does not set the values of such characteristics only if certain conditions are met. 

604.4. Many Weapons have static effects that modify the object they’re attached to, but those effects don’t target that object. If a Weapon is moved to a different object, the effect stops applying to the original object and starts modifying the new one. 

604.5. Some static effects apply while a card is in any zone that you could play it from \(usual y your hand\). These are limited to those that read, “You may play this card…” or “You can’t play this card…” or “Play this card only if…”. 

604.6. Unlike cards and other kinds of effects, static effects can’t use an object’s last known information for purposes of determining how their effects are applied. 

## 605. Card and Effect Resolution 

605.1. Each time al players pass priority in succession, the topmost card or effect in Standby resolves \(see rule 606\). 

605.2. If the object that’s resolving is a card, its resolution may involve several steps. The steps described in rules 605.2a-j are fol owed as appropriate, in no specific order. 

605.2a. The control er of the card fol ows its instructions in the order written. However, replacement effects may modify these steps. In some cases, later text on the card may modify the meaning of earlier text \(for example, “Negate the Action card being played. 

If that card is negated this way, put it on top of its owner’s deck instead of into its 

owner’s Oblivion.”\) Don’t just apply effects step by step without thinking in these cases—read the whole text and apply the rules of English to the text. 

605.2b. If a card offers any choices other than choices already made as part of playing the card, the player declares these while applying the effect. The player can’t choose an option that’s il egal or impossible, with the exception that having a deck with no cards in it doesn’t make drawing a card an impossible action \(see rule 104.3c\). 

Example: A card \(or an effect’s\) instruction reads, “You may send a Clash card you control to Oblivion. If you don’t, your Contender loses three health.” A player who controls no Clash cards can’t choose the “send to Oblivion” option. 

605.2c. If a card divides or distributes something, such as damage or Counters, as a player chooses among any number of untargeted players and/or objects, the player chooses the amount and division such that each chosen player or object receives at least one of whatever is being divided. \(Note that if an effect divides or distributes something, such as damage or Counters, as a player chooses among some number of target objects and/or players, the amount and division were determined as the card or effect was put into Standby rather than at this time. 

605.2d. Some cards and effects have multiple steps or actions, denoted by separate sentences or clauses, that involve multiple players. In these cases, the choices for the first action are made in APNAP order, and then the first action is processed simultaneously. Then the choices for the second action are made in APNAP order, and then that action is processed simultaneously, and so on \(see rule 101.4\). 

605.2e. Some cards and effects include actions taken on multiple players and/or objects. 

In most cases, each such action is processed simultaneously. If the action can’t be processed simultaneously, it’s instead processed considering each affected player or object individual y. APNAP order is used to make the primary determination of the order of those actions. Secondarily, if the action is to be taken on both a player and an object they control or on multiple objects control ed by the same player, the player who controls the resolving card or effect chooses the relative order of those actions. 

605.2f. If an effect requires information from the game \(such as the number of Clash cards in play\), the answer is determined only once, when the effect is applied. If the effect requires information from a specific object, including the source of the effect itself, the effect uses the current information of that object if it’s in the public zone it was expected to be in; if it’s no longer in that zone, or if the effect has moved it from a public zone to a hidden zone, the effect uses the object’s last known information. If an effect states that an object does something, it’s the object as it exists \(or as it most recently existed\) that does it, not the effect. 

605.2g. If an effect refers to certain characteristics, it checks only for the value of the specified characteristics, regardless of any related ones an object may also have. 

Example: An effect that reads “Send al blue Clash cards to Oblivion” wil send a white-and-blue Clash card to Oblivion, but one that reads “Send al non-blue Clash cards to Oblivion” doesn’t. 

605.3h. If the object that’s resolving has a target, it checks whether the target is stil legal, as described in rule 608.2b. Otherwise, the card \(or effect\) doesn’t resolve. It is removed from Standby and put into its owner’s Oblivion. 

605.3i. If a permanent card resolves but its control er can’t put it in the corresponding 

“in-play” zone, that player puts it into its owner’s Oblivion. 

605.2j. As the final part of an Action card’s resolution, the card is put into its owner’s Oblivion. As the final part of an effect’s resolution, the effect is removed from Standby and ceases to exist. 

## 606. Effect 

606.1. An effect is something that happens in the game as a result of a card or another effect. 

When a card, activated effect, or triggered effect resolves, it may create one or more one-shot or continuous effects. Static effects may create one or more continuous effects. The text on a card denotes that card’s effects \(or put simply, its card effects\). 

606.1a. If there are multiple simultaneous effects \(one-shot and/or continuous triggered effects\) control ed by a player that trigger at the same time, the player who controls the sources of those effects chooses which order to place those effects into Standby and thus the order in which those effects resolve. 

606.2. Effects apply only to permanents unless the instruction’s text states otherwise, or they clearly can apply only to objects in one or more other zones. 

Example: An effect that changes al Clash cards into Harbingers won’t alter Clash cards in players’ Oblivions. But an effect that says “Clashgrounds cost one additional resource of any color to play…” wil apply only to Clashgrounds put into Standby as part of their resolution of play. 

606.3. If an effect attempts to do something impossible, it does only as much as possible. 

Example: If a player is holding only one card, an effect that reads “Discard two cards” causes them to discard only that one card. If an effect moves cards out of the deck \(as opposed to drawing\), it moves as many as possible. 

606.4. If an effect could result in a draw, the text of the card or effect may specify what to do in the event of a draw. If it does not, the game simply ends in a draw \(see rule 104.4\). 

606.5. Some continuous effects are replacement effects or prevention effects \(see rules 609 and 610\). 

606.6. Some effects apply to damage from a source—for example, “The next time a red source of your choice would deal clash damage to you this turn, prevent that damage.” 

606.6a. If an effect requires a player to choose a source of damage, they may choose a permanent, a card in Standby, or any object referred to by an object in Standby \(either by a replacement or prevention effect that’s waiting to apply, or by a delayed triggered effect that’s waiting to trigger; even if that object is no longer in the zone it used to be in\). A source doesn’t need to be capable of dealing damage to be a legal choice. The source is chosen when the effect is created. If the player chooses a permanent, the effect wil apply to the next damage dealt by that permanent, regardless of whether it’s clash damage or non-clash damage dealt as the result of that permanent’s effect. If the player chooses a card in Standby, the effect wil apply to any damage dealt by that card when it resolves. 

606.6b. Some static effects prevent or replace damage from sources with certain properties. For these effects, the prevention or replacement applies to sources that are permanents with that property and to any sources that aren’t in play that have that property. 

## 607. One-Shot Effects 

607.1. A one-shot effect does something just once and doesn’t have a duration. Examples include \(but are not limited to\) dealing damage, sending a permanent to Oblivion, creating a token, and moving an object from one zone to another. 

607.2. Some one-shot effects create a delayed triggered effect, which instructs a player to do something later in the game \(usual y at a specific time\) rather than as the card or effect that’s creating the one-shot effect resolves \(see rule 603.7\). 

607.3. Some one-shot effects cause an object to change zones “until” a specified event occurs. A second one-shot effect is created immediately after the specified event. This second one-shot effect returns the object to its previous zone. 

## 608. Continuous Effects 

608.1. A continuous effect modifies characteristics of objects, modifies control of objects, or affects players or the rules of the game, for a fixed or indefinite period. 

608.2. A continuous effect may be generated by the resolution of a card or effect. 

608.2a. A continuous effect generated by the resolution of a card or effect lasts as long as stated by the card or effect creating it \(such as “until end of turn”\). If no duration is stated, it lasts until the end of the game. 

608.2b. Some continuous effects generated by the resolution of a card or effect have durations worded “while this card…” and if the “while this card…” duration never starts, or it ends before the moment the effect would first be applied, the effect does nothing. 

It doesn’t start and immediately stop again, and it doesn’t last forever. 

608.2c. If a continuous effect generated by the resolution of a card or effect modifies the characteristics or changes the control er of any objects, the set of objects it affects is determined when that continuous effect begins. After that point, the set won’t change. 

\(Note that this works differently than a continuous effect from a static effect.\) A continuous effect generated by the resolution of a card or effect that doesn’t modify the characteristics or change the control er of any objects modifies the rules of the game, so it can affect objects that weren’t affected when that continuous effect began. If a single continuous effect has parts that modify the characteristics or changes the control er of any objects and other parts that don’t, the set of objects each part applies to is determined independently. 

Example: An effect that reads “\(Alpha Hunter\) Clash cards get \+1/\+1 until end of turn” 

gives the bonus to al permanents that are \(Alpha Hunter\) Clash cards when the card or effect resolves— even if they change Affiliation later—and doesn’t affect those that enter play or become \(Alpha Hunters\) afterward. 

Example: An effect that reads “Prevent al clash damage Clash cards would deal this turn” doesn’t modify any object’s characteristics, so it’s modifying the rules of the game. 

That means the effect wil apply to clash damage from Clash cards that weren’t in play when the continuous effect began. 

608.2d. If a resolving card or effect that creates a continuous effect contains a variable such as X, the value of that variable is determined only once, on resolution. 

608.3. A continuous effect may be generated by the static effect of an object. 

608.3a. The effect applies at al times that the permanent generating it is in play or the object generating it is in the appropriate zone. 

Example: A permanent with the static effect “Al white Clash cards get \+1/\+1” generates an effect that continuously gives \+1/\+1 to each white Clash card in play. If a Clash card becomes white, it gets this bonus; a Clash card that stops being white loses it. 

608.3b. Continuous effects that modify characteristics of permanents do so simultaneously with the permanent entering play. They don’t wait until the permanent is in play and then change it. Because such effects apply as the permanent enters the battlefield, they are applied within the same timing as a permanent with a Trigger - 

Enter effect. 

Example: A permanent with the static effect “Al Rogue Clash cards get \+1/\+1” is in play. 

A 1/1 \(Rogue\) Clash card enters play as a 2/2, not a 1/1. That Clash card doesn’t enter the Clash Zone as 1/1 and then change to 2/2. 

## 609. Replacement Effects 

609.1. Some continuous effects are replacement effects. Like prevention effects \(see rule 610\), replacement effects apply continuously as events happen. Such effects watch for a particular event that would happen and completely or partial y replace that event with a different event. 

They act like “barriers” around whatever they’re affecting. 

609.1a. Effects that use the word “instead” are replacement effects. Most replacement effects use the word “instead” to indicate what events wil be replaced with other events. 

609.1b. Effects that use the word “skip” are replacement effects. These replacement effects use the word “skip” to indicate what events, steps, phases, or turns wil be replaced with nothing. 

609.1c. Effects that read “\[This permanent\] enters play with… or “\[This permanent\] 

enters play engaged…,” etc. are replacement effects. 

609.1d. Continuous effects that read “\[Objects\] enter play…” are replacement effects. 

609.2. Some replacement effects apply to damage from a source \(see rule 606.6\). 

609.3. There are no special restrictions on playing a card or activating an effect that generates a replacement effect. Such effects last until they’re used up or their duration has expired. 

609.4. Replacement effects must exist before the appropriate event occurs—they can’t “go back in time” and change something that’s already happened. Cards or effects that generate these effects are often played or activated in response to whatever would produce the event and thus resolve before that event would occur. 

609.5. A replacement effect doesn’t invoke itself repeatedly; it gets only one opportunity to affect an event or any modified events that may replace that event. 

Example: A player controls two Clash cards, each with an effect that reads “If a Clash card you control would deal clash damage to a Contender, it deals double that damage to that Contender instead.” A Clash card that normal y deals two damage wil deal eight damage \(not just four, and not an infinite amount.\) 

609.6. If an event is replaced, it never happens. A modified event occurs instead, which may in turn trigger effects. Note that the modified event may contain instructions that can’t be carried out, in which case the impossible instruction is simply ignored. 

609.7. If a replacement effect would replace an event, but that event never happens, the replacement effect simply doesn’t do anything. 

609.7a. If a source would deal 0 damage, it does not deal damage at al . Replacement effects that would increase the damage dealt by that source or would have that source deal that damage to a different object, have no event to replace, so they have no effect. 

609.8. An effect that causes a player to skip an event, step, phase, or turn is a replacement effect. “Skip \[something\]” is the same as “Instead of doing \[something\], do nothing.” Once a step, phase, or turn has started, it can no longer be skipped—any skip effects wil wait until the next occurrence. 

609.8a. Anything scheduled for a skipped step, phase, or turn won’t happen. Anything scheduled for the “next” occurrence of something waits for the first occurrence that isn’t skipped. If two effects each cause a player to skip their next occurrence, that player 

must skip the next two; one effect wil be satisfied in skipping the first occurrence, while the other wil remain until another occurrence can be skipped. 

609.8b. Some effects cause a player to skip a step, phase, or turn, then take another action. That action is considered to be the first thing that happens during the next step, phase, or turn to actual y occur. 

609.9. Some effects replace card draws. These effects are applied even if no cards could be drawn because there are no cards in the affected player’s deck. 

609.9a. If an effect replaces a draw within a sequence of card draws, al actions required by the replacement are completed, if possible, before resuming the sequence. 

609.9b. If an effect would have a player both draw a card and perform an additional action on that card, and the draw is replaced, the additional action is not performed on any cards that are drawn as a result of that replacement effect. 

609.10. Some replacement effects modify how a permanent enters play \(see rules 609.1c-d\). 

Such effects may come from the permanent itself if they affect only that permanent \(as opposed to a general subset of permanents that includes it\). They may also come from other sources. To determine which replacement effects, apply and how they apply, check the characteristics of the permanent as it would exist in play. 

609.10a. If a replacement effect that modifies how a permanent enters play requires a choice, that choice is made before the permanent enters play. 

609.11. An effect that modifies how a permanent enters play may cause other objects to change zones. 

609.11a. While applying an effect that modifies how a permanent enters play, you may have to choose a number of objects that wil also change zones. You can’t choose the object that wil become that permanent or any other object entering play at the same time as that object. 

609.11b. The same object can’t be chosen to change zones more than once when applying replacement effects that modify how a single permanent enters play. 

609.12. Some effects state that something can’t happen. These effects aren’t replacement effects but fol ow similar rules. 

609.12a. “Can’t” effects must exist before the appropriate event occurs—they can’t “go back in time” and change something that’s already happened. 

609.12b. If an event can’t happen, a player can’t choose to pay a cost that includes that event. 

## 610. Prevention Effects 

610.1. Some continuous effects are prevention effects. Like replacement effects \(see rule 609\), prevention effects apply continuously as events happen—they aren’t locked in ahead of time. 

Such effects watch for a damage event that would happen and completely or partial y prevent the damage that would be dealt. They act like “barriers” around whatever they’re affecting. 

610.1a. Effects that use the word “prevent” are prevention effects. Prevention effects use “prevent” or “can’t be dealt” to indicate what damage wil not be dealt. 

610.2. Many prevention effects apply to damage from a source \(see rule 606.6\). 

610.3. There are no special restrictions on playing a card or activating an effect that generates a prevention effect. Such effects last until they’re used up or their duration has expired. 

610.4. Prevention effects must exist before the appropriate damage event occurs—they can’t 

“go back in time” and change something that’s already happened. Cards or effects that generate these effects are often played or activated in response to whatever would produce the event and thus resolve before that event would occur. 

Example: A player can play a card or activate an effect that “prevents the next two clash damage dealt to target Clash card they control” in response to a card or effect that would deal damage. Once the damaging effect resolves, though, it’s too late to prevent the damage. 

610.5. Some prevention effects also include an additional effect, which may refer to the amount of damage that was prevented. The prevention takes place at the time the original event would have happened; the rest of the effect takes place immediately afterward. 

610.6. If damage that would be dealt is prevented, it never happens. A modified event may occur instead, which may in turn trigger effects. Note that the modified event may contain instructions that can’t be carried out, in which case the impossible instruction is simply ignored. 

610.7. Some prevention effects generated by the resolution of a card or effect refer to a specific amount of damage—for example, “Prevent the next two clash damage that would be dealt to target Clash card this turn.” These work like barriers. Each 1 damage that would be dealt to the 

“protected” permanent is prevented. Preventing 1 damage reduces the remaining barrier by 1. 

If damage would be dealt to the “protected” permanent or player by two or more applicable sources at the same time, the player, or the control er of the permanent chooses which damage the barrier prevents. Once the barrier has been reduced to 0, any remaining damage is dealt normal y. Such effects count only the amount of damage; the number of events or sources dealing the damage doesn’t matter. 

610.8. Some prevention effects generated by the resolution of a card or effect refer to the “next time” a specific source would deal damage. These effects prevent the next instance of damage from that source, regardless of how much damage that is. Once an instance of damage from that source has been prevented, any subsequent instances of damage that would be dealt by that source are dealt normal y. 

610.9. Some effects generated by the resolution of a card or effect prevent damage from a source of a player’s choice with certain properties. When the source would deal damage, the barrier rechecks the source’s properties. If the properties no longer match, the damage isn’t prevented or replaced, and the barrier isn’t used up. 

610.10. Some prevention effects generated by static effects refer to a specific amount of damage—for example, “If a source would deal damage to your Contender, prevent one of that damage.” Such an effect prevents only the indicated amount of damage in any applicable damage event at any given time. It wil apply separately to damage from other applicable events that would happen at the same time, or at a different time. 

610.11. Some prevention effects prevent the next N damage that would be dealt to each of a number of untargeted Clash cards. Such an effect creates a prevention barrier for each applicable Clash card when the card or effect resolves. 

610.12. Some effects state that damage “can’t be prevented.” If unpreventable damage would be dealt, any applicable prevention effects are stil applied to it. Those effects won’t prevent any damage, but any additional effects they have wil take place. Existing damage prevention barriers won’t be reduced by damage that can’t be prevented. 

610.12a. A prevention effect is applied to any particular unpreventable damage event just once. It won’t invoke itself repeatedly trying to prevent that damage. 

610.13. Some triggered effects trigger when damage that would be dealt is prevented. Such an effect triggers each time a prevention effect is applied to one or more simultaneous damage events and prevents some or al of that damage. 

610.14. If a permanent has multiple instances of an effect that care if damage is prevented, the control er of that permanent must choose which effect to resolve when damage is dealt. In other words, damage can’t be prevented multiple times to gain the effects of multiple damage prevention effects. 





7. Additional Rules 

700. General 

## 701. Events 

701.1. Anything that happens in a game is an event. Multiple events may take place during the resolution of a card or effect. The text of triggered effects and replacement effects defines the event they’re looking for. One “happening” may be treated as a single event by one effect and as multiple events by another. 

Example: If an attacking Clash card is obstructed by two Clash cards, this is one event for a triggered effect that reads “Whenever this Clash card becomes obstructed” but two events for a triggered effect that reads “Whenever this Clash card becomes obstructed by a Clash card.” 

## 702. Modal Cards and Effects 

702.1. A card or effect is modal if it has two or more options in a bul eted list preceded by instructions for a player to choose a number of those options, such as “Choose one —.” Each of those options is a mode. 

702.1a. The control er of a modal card or effect chooses the mode\(s\) as part of playing the card or activating that effect. If one of the modes would be il egal \(due to an inability to choose legal targets, for example\), that mode can’t be chosen \(see rule 603.3c\). 

702.1b. The control er of a modal triggered effect chooses the mode\(s\) as part of putting that effect into Standby. If one of the modes would be il egal \(due to an inability to choose legal targets, for example\), that mode can’t be chosen. If no mode is chosen, the effect is removed from Standby. 

702.1c. If a card or effect targets one or more targets only if a particular mode is chosen for it, its control er would need to choose those targets only if they chose that mode. 

Otherwise, the card or effect is treated as though it did not have those targets. 

702.1d. If a player is al owed to choose more than one mode for a modal card or effect, that player normal y can’t choose the same mode more than once. However, some modal cards include the instruction “You may choose the same mode more than once.” 

If a particular mode is chosen multiple times, the card is treated as if that mode appeared that many times in sequence. If that mode requires a target, the same player or object may be chosen as the target for each of those modes, or different targets may be chosen. 

702.1e. Some cards and effects specify that a player other than their control er chooses a mode for it. In that case, the other player does so when the card or effect’s control er normal y would do so. If there is more than one other player who could make such a choice, the card or effect’s control er decides which of those players wil make the choice. 

702.1f. Modal cards and effects may have different targeting requirements for each mode. Changing a card or effect’s target can’t change its mode. 

702.1g. A copy of a modal card or effect copies the mode\(s\) chosen for it. The control er of the copy can’t choose a different mode, unless otherwise specified. 

## 703. Keyword Actions 

703.1. Most actions described in a card’s rules text use the standard English definitions of the verbs within, but some specialized verbs are used whose meanings may not be clear. These 

“keywords actions” are game terms; sometimes reminder text summarizes their meanings. 

703.2. Attach 

703.2a. To attach an object to another object means to take it from where it currently is and put it onto that new object. If something is attached to a permanent in play, it’s customary to place it so that it’s physical y touching the permanent. Some objects can only be attached to a certain object based on its characteristics. \(For example, a Weapon can only be attached to a Clash card.\) 

703.2b. An object with the word “Attach” fol owed by a resource cost, has the effect, 

“Pay this cost to attach this card to an eligible target.” This is an activated effect. 

703.2c. When an object has another object attached, both objects are considered attached to each other. 

703.3. Play 

703.3a. To play a card is to take it from the zone it’s in \(usual y the hand\), put it into Standby, and pay its costs, so that it wil eventual y resolve and have its effect. A player may play a card if they have priority \(see rule 601\). 

703.4. Negate 

703.4a. To negate a card or effect means to cancel it, removing it from Standby. It doesn’t resolve and none of its effects occur. A negated card is put into its owner’s Oblivion. A negated effect is removed from Standby. 

703.4b. To negate an attack means to end the current Clash Phase after al effects in Standby have resolved. No subsequent steps happen, and the active player returns to their Primary Phase. 

703.4c. The player who played a negated card, activated a negated effect, or had their attack negated doesn’t get a “refund” of any costs that were paid for that game action. 

703.5. Create 

703.5a. To create one or more tokens with certain characteristics, put the specified number of tokens with the specified characteristics into their corresponding zones under their owner’s control. 

703.6. Send to Oblivion 

703.6a. To send \(a permanent\) to Oblivion, move it from play \(or from Standby if applicable\) to its owner’s Oblivion. 

703.6b. The only ways a permanent can be sent to Oblivion are as a result of an effect that uses the phrase “send \[object\] to Oblivion” or damage from a source with Necrotic \(see rule 704.11\). An object that is “put” into its owner’s Oblivion for any other reason, is not the same as being “sent to Oblivion”. Note that being defeated is not synonymous with being “sent to Oblivion” \(see rules 504.2f and 706\). 

703.6c. “Send to Oblivion” is not the same as being “defeated.” 

703.7. Discard 

703.7a. To discard a card, move it from its owner’s hand to that player’s Oblivion. 

703.7b. By default, effects that cause a player to discard a card al ow the affected player to choose which card to discard. Some effects, however, require a random discard or al ow another player to choose which card is discarded. 

703.7c. If a card is discarded as part of a cost of a card or effect, but a replacement effect places the discarded card into another zone other than that player’s Oblivion, that cost payment is il egal; the game returns to the moment before the cost was paid \(see rule 708\). 

703.8. Reveal 

703.8a. To reveal a card, show that card to al players for a brief time. If an effect causes a card to be revealed, it remains revealed for as long as necessary to complete the parts of the effect that card is relevant to. If the cost to play a card or activate an effect includes revealing a card, the card remains revealed from the time the card or effect is declared until the time it leaves Standby. If revealing a card causes a triggered effect to trigger, the card remains revealed until that triggered effect leaves Standby. If that effect isn’t put into Standby the next time a player would receive priority, the card ceases to be revealed. 

703.8b. Revealing a card doesn’t cause it to leave the zone it’s in. 

703.8c. If cards in a player’s deck are shuffled or otherwise reordered, any revealed cards that are reordered stop being revealed and become new objects. 

703.8d. Some effects instruct a player to look at one or more cards. Looking at a card fol ows the same rules as revealing a card, except that the card is shown only to the specified player. 

703.9. Search 

703.9a. To search for a card in a zone, look at al cards in that zone \(even if it’s a hidden zone\) and find a card that matches the given description. 

703.9b. If a player is searching a hidden zone for cards with a stated quality, such as a card with a certain card type or cost, that player isn’t required to find some or al of those cards even if they’re present in that zone. 

703.9c. If a player is instructed to search a hidden zone for cards that match an undefined quality, that player may stil search that zone but can’t find any cards. 

703.9d. If a player is searching a hidden zone simply for a quantity of cards, such as “a card” or “three cards,” that player must find that many cards \(or as many as possible if the zone doesn’t contain enough cards\). 

703.9e. If the effect that contains the search instruction doesn’t also contain instructions to reveal the found card\(s\), then they’re not revealed. 

703.9f. If searching a zone is replaced with searching a portion of that zone, any other instructions that refer to searching the zone stil apply. 

703.9g. Any effects that trigger on a deck being searched wil trigger. 

703.9h. If an effect offers a player a choice to search a zone and take additional actions with the cards found, that player may choose to search even if the additional actions are il egal or impossible. 

703.9i. If multiple players search at once, each of those players looks at the appropriate cards at the same time, then those players decide in APNAP order \(see rule 101.4\) which card to find. 

703.10. Shuffle 

703.10a. To shuffle a deck or a face-down pile of cards, randomize the cards within it so that no player knows their order. 

703.10b. Some effects cause a player to search a deck for a card or cards, shuffle that deck, then put some or al of the found cards into a different zone or in a certain position in that deck. In such cases, the found cards aren’t included in the shuffle, even though they remain in the deck at that time. Rather, al the cards in that deck except those are shuffled. Effects that trigger when a deck is shuffled wil stil trigger \(see rule 401\). 

703.10c. If an effect would cause a player to shuffle one or more specific objects into a deck, that deck is shuffled even if none of those objects are in the zone they’re expected to be in or an effect causes al of those objects to be moved to another zone or remain in their current zone. 

703.10d. If an effect would cause a player to shuffle a set of objects into a deck, that deck is shuffled even if there are no objects in that set. 

703.10e. If an effect causes a player to shuffle a deck containing zero or one cards, effects that trigger when a deck is shuffled wil stil trigger. 

703.10f. If two or more effects cause a deck to be shuffled multiple times simultaneously, effects that trigger when that deck is shuffled wil trigger that many times. 

703.11. Ready and Engage 

703.11a. To engage a permanent, turn it sideways from an upright position. Only ready permanents can be engaged. In other words, you can’t engage an engaged card. 

703.11b. To ready a permanent, rotate it back to the upright position from a horizontal position. Only engaged permanents can be readied. In other words, you can’t ready a ready card. 



703.12. Return 

703.12a. An object can be returned to a hidden zone from its current public zone by a card or effect. The instruction of which zones to return to and from wil be outlined in the card’s text. 

703.12b. To return a permanent to its owner’s hand, is to move it from play to its owner’s hand. 

703.12c. To return a card “being played” to its owner’s hand, is to move it from Standby to its owner’s hand. 

703.12d. To return a card from a player’s Oblivion to their hand, is to move it from Oblivion to its owner’s hand. 



703.13. Add 

703.13a. An object can be added to a player’s hand. This is similar to put but is not the same as drawing a card. 



703.14. Put 

703.14a. An object can be put into a player’s hand, into play, into Oblivion, or on top/bottom of their deck etc. Put is not the same as playing a card. 



703.14a.1. Resources are put into the Resource Zone, not played. 

## 704. Keyword Abilities 

704.1. Most abilities describe exactly what they do in the card’s rules text. Some, though, are very common or would require too much space to define on the card. In these cases, the object lists only the name of the ability as a “keyword”; sometimes reminder text summarizes the game rule. 

704.1a. If an effect refers to a “\[keyword ability\] cost,” it refers only to the variable costs for that keyword. 

704.1b. An effect may refer to an object “with \[keyword ability\]” or “that has \[keyword ability\].” This means the same thing as an object “with a \[keyword ability\] ability” or an object “that has a \[keyword ability\] ability.” 

704.2. Awe Factor \{X\} 

704.2a. Awe Factor \{X\} is a triggered ability. 

704.2b. Awe Factor \{X\} is also a numbered ability. 

704.2c. A card with Awe Factor \{X\} has the fol owing effect, “When this card enters play, al Clash cards you don’t control get -X/-0 until end of turn.” 

Example: A Clash card with Awe Factor 2 enters play. Then al Clash cards not control ed by that player wil get -2/-0 until the end of the turn in which the Clash card with Awe Factor 2 entered play. 

704.2d. Multiple instances of a numbered ability do not stack. If there are multiple instances of a numbered ability \(e.g., Awe Factor 2 and Awe Factor 1\) the player that controls that object must apply the higher of the two numbered abilities. 

704.3. Barrage \{X\} 

704.3a. Barrage \{X\} is a triggered ability. 

704.3b. Barrage \{X\} is also a numbered ability. 

704.3c. A card with Barrage \{X\} has the fol owing effect, “When this card attacks, you may deal damage equal to its initial attack power divided as you choose among up to X 

target Clash cards.” 

Note: Initial attack power is the attack power printed on the card before augmentations have been applied to that value. 

704.3d. Barrage \{X\} requires the player to divide or distribute damage among one or more targets, the player declares the division. Each of those targets must receive at least one of the damage being divided \(see rule 601.1d\). 

Example: A 6/6 Clash card with Barrage 2 attacks. The player who controls that Clash card chooses two target Clash cards and deals 6 damage divided as they choose to those two Clash cards. They may choose to deal 1 to one Clash card and 5 damage to the other, 2 and 4, or 3 and 3 damage. 

704.3e. Multiple instances of a numbered ability do not stack. If there are multiple instances of a numbered ability \(e.g., Awe Factor 2 and Awe Factor 1\) the player that controls that object must apply the higher of the two numbered abilities. 





704.4. Breakthrough 

704.4a. Breakthrough is a static ability that modifies the rules for assigning an attacking Clash card’s clash damage. The ability has no effect when a creature with Breakthrough is obstructing or is dealing \(or is dealt\) non-clash damage. 

704.4b. A card with Breakthrough has the fol owing effect, “This attacking Clash card deals excessive clash damage to an opponent’s Contender if its attack power is higher than the total defense power of al opposing Clash cards in this Clash.” 

704.4b.1. If a Contender gains Breakthrough, replace the phrase “This attacking Clash card” with “This attacking Contender”. This is an exception to the definition outlined in rule 704.4b. 

704.4c. Excessive clash damage is defined as the difference in the attacker’s attack power and the total defense power of al opposing Clash cards in that clash. 

704.4c.1. Excessive clash damage, such as that from Breakthrough, is dealt as an additional separate instance of clash damage to an opponent’s Contender. 

Example: A 4/4 Clash card with Breakthrough is obstructed by two 1/1 Clash cards. The total defense power of al opposing Clash cards in this Clash is 2 and the total attack power of the attacker is 4. Thus, two excessive clash damage is dealt as a separate instance to the defending player’s Contender. 

704.4d. If the attacking Clash card has the Breakthrough ability and the target of their attack leaves play due to a card effect, excessive clash damage is stil dealt to the defending Contender. In other words, if the attacking Clash card with Breakthrough is obstructed and that obstructor is removed from the Clash by a card effect the total defense power of al opposing Clash cards is considered to be 0 \(see rule 504.4a\) 704.4e. Multiple instances of Breakthrough on the same card are redundant. 

704.5. Close Combat 

704.5a. Close Combat is a static ability that modifies the rules for attacking a Clash card. 

704.5b. A card with Close Combat has the fol owing effect, “This card can attack ready Clash cards.” 

704.5c. Cards that are attacked can’t be declared as an obstructor for themselves. See rule 303.10. 

704.5d. Multiple instances of Close Combat on the same card are redundant. 

704.6. Enrage \{X\} 

704.6a. Enrage \{X\} is a triggered ability. 

704.6b. Enrage \{X\} is also a numbered ability. 

704.6c. A card with Enrage \{X\} has the fol owing effect, “Whenever this card is dealt non-clash damage, it gets \+X/\+0 until end of turn for each point of non-clash damage it was just dealt.” 

Example: A 2/2 Clash card with Enrage 1 is dealt one non-clash damage. That Clash card is now a 3/1 until end of turn. 

704.6d. Multiple instances of a numbered ability do not stack. If there are multiple instances of a numbered ability \(e.g., Awe Factor 2 and Awe Factor 1\) the player that controls that object must apply the higher of the two numbered abilities. 

704.7. Exclusive 

704.7a. Exclusive is a static ability that modifies the rules for playing a card and/or for a card entering play. 

704.7b. A card with Exclusive has the fol owing effect, “Only one copy of this card can be in your control.” 

704.7c. If a player controls a card with Exclusive, they may not play a card from their hand with the same card name. 

704.7d. If a player controls a card with Exclusive, a card with the same name may not enter play under their control by any card effect. That card is considered an invalid target of that effect. 

704.7e. Multiple instances of Exclusive on the same card are redundant. 

704.8. Flight 

704.8a. Flight is an evasion ability that alters the rules of a Clash. 

704.8b. A card with Flight has the fol owing effect, “This card can only be obstructed by Clash cards with Flight or Interception.” 

704.8c. A Clash card with Flight can obstruct a Clash card with or without Flight. 

704.8d. An engaged Clash card with Flight can be attacked by an opposing Clash card. 

704.8e. A ready Clash card with Flight can be attacked by a Clash card with Close Combat. 

704.8f. Multiple instances of Flight on the same card are redundant. 

704.9. Interception 

704.9a. Interception is a static ability. 

704.9b. A card with Interception has the fol owing effect, “This card can obstruct Clash cards with Flight.” 

704.9c. A Clash card with Interception can obstruct a Clash card with or without Flight. 

704.9d. Multiple instances of Interception on the same card are redundant. 

704.10. Irrefutable 

704.10a. Irrefutable is a static ability that modifies the rules for playing a card. 

704.10b. A card with Irrefutable has the fol owing effect, “This card can’t be prevented from entering play.” 

704.10c. Multiple instances of Irrefutable on the same card are redundant. 

704.11. Necrotic 

704.11a. Necrotic is a static ability. 

704.11b. A card with Necrotic has the fol owing effect, “Any Clash card that is dealt clash damage by this card wil be sent to Oblivion after that Clash.” 

704.11c. Any nonzero amount of clash damage assigned to a Clash card by a source with Necrotic is considered to be lethal damage regardless of that Clash card’s defense. 

704.11d. If a Clash card with Necrotic deals clash damage to an opposing Clash card thus reducing its defense to zero \(or less\) that opposing Clash card is considered “defeated”. 

The state-based effect of being “defeated” wil supersede the effects of Necrotic. 

704.11e. If a Clash card with Necrotic deals clash damage to an opposing Clash card and doesn’t reduce its defense to zero \(or less\) then “after that Clash” the opposing Clash card wil be “sent to Oblivion.” Note: This is not being defeated and wil not trigger any Trigger - Defeat effects. 

704.11f. Multiple instances of Necrotic on the same card are redundant. 

704.12. Observant 

704.12a. Observant is a static ability that modifies the rules for attacking. 

704.12b. A card with Observant has the fol owing effect, “This card can’t attack the turn it enters play.” 

704.12c. Multiple instances of Observant on the same card are redundant. 

704.13. Superspeed 

704.13a. Superspeed is a static ability that modifies the rules for dealing clash damage. 

704.13b. A card with Superspeed has the fol owing effect, “This card deals clash damage before Clash cards without Superspeed.” 

Example: A 2/2 Clash card with Superspeed attacks an engaged 4/2 Clash card without Superspeed. The 2/2 \(with Superspeed\) wil deal damage to the 4/2 Clash card \(without Superspeed\) thus defeating it before the 4/2 gets a chance to deal damage to the 2/2 

\(with Superspeed\). 

704.13c. A Clash card with Superspeed wil not be dealt clash damage if the opposing Clash card without Superspeed is defeated. But if the opposing Clash card without Superspeed is not defeated, clash damage wil resolve normal y. If the attacking and defending Clash cards both have Superspeed, then damage is dealt normal y. 

704.13d. The effects of Superspeed apply during al player’s turns. 

704.13e. If the Clash card/Contenders involved in a Clash al have Superspeed, then the effects of Superspeed don’t apply. However, if at least one of those objects loses Superspeed, then the objects with Superspeed wil now apply their effect. 

704.13f. Multiple instances of Superspeed on the same card are redundant. 

704.14. Undisputed 

704.14a. Undisputed is a static ability. 

704.14b. A card with Undisputed has the fol owing effect, “This Clash card can’t be defeated during a Clash on your turn.” 

704.14c. If a Clash card with Undisputed is dealt lethal damage, it is not “defeated”. 

After the Clash, the Clash card with Undisputed wil have its defense reset to its pre-Clash amount. 

704.14d. Multiple instances of Undisputed on the same card are redundant. 

704.15. Unrivaled 

704.15a. Unrivaled is a static ability that modifies the deck-building rules of the Alpha Clash Trading Card Game. 

704.15b. A card with Unrivaled has the fol owing effect, “Only one card with Unrivaled is al owed per deck.” 

704.15b.1. Only one card with Unrivaled is al owed per deck, including a player’s sideboard. 

704.15c. Multiple instances of Unrivaled on the same card are redundant. 

## 705. Turn-Based Actions 

705.1. Turn-based actions are game actions that happen automatical y when certain steps or phases begin, or when each step and phase ends. Turn-based actions don’t use Standby. 

705.1a. Effects that watch for a specified step or phase to begin are triggered effects, not turn-based actions \(see rule 603\). 

705.2. Turn-based actions are not control ed by any player. 

705.3. Whenever a step or phase begins, if it’s a step or phase that has any turn-based action associated with it, those turn-based actions are automatical y dealt with first. This happens before state-based actions are checked, before triggered effects are put into Standby, and 

before players receive priority. However, turn-based actions can be replaced by various replacement effects. 

705.4. The turn-based actions are as fol ows: 

- Ready Step: Ready al Clash cards you control. 

- Draw Step: Draw one card from the top of your deck. 

## 706. State-Based Actions 

706.1. State-based actions are game actions that happen automatical y whenever certain conditions \(listed below\) are met. State-based actions don’t use Standby. 

706.1a. Effects that watch for a specified game state are triggered effects, not state-based actions \(see rule 603\). 

706.2. State-based actions are checked throughout the game and are not control ed by any player. 

706.3. Whenever a player has priority, the game checks for any of the listed conditions for state-based actions, then performs al applicable state-based actions simultaneously as a single event. 

706.4. Unlike triggered effects, state-based actions pay no attention to what happens during the resolution of a card or effect. 

706.5. The state-based actions are as fol ows: 

 If a player’s Contender has 0 or less health, that player loses the game. 

 If a player attempts to draw a card from a deck with no cards, that player loses the game. 

 If a Clash card’s defense is 0 \(or less\), it is considered “defeated” and is put into its owner’s Oblivion \(after al Trigger – Defeat effects for that card have resolved\). 

Trigger - Defeat effects of the defeated Clash card trigger per the rules of state triggers \(see rule 603.8\). 

 A token that is sent from play to a zone not in play ceases to exist. 

## 707. Taking Shortcuts 

707.1. When playing a game, players typical y make use of mutual y understood shortcuts rather than explicitly identifying each game choice a player makes. 

707.1a. The rules for taking shortcuts are largely informal. As long as each player in the game understands the intent of each other player, any shortcut system they use is acceptable. 

707.1b. Tournaments may use a modified version of the rules governing shortcuts. 

These rules are covered in the Alpha Clash Trading Card Game Tournament Rules Manual. 

## 708. Handling Il egal Actions 

708.1. If a player takes an il egal action or starts to take an action but can’t legal y complete it, the entire action is reversed and any payments already made are canceled. No effects trigger and no effects apply as a result of an undone action. If the action was playing a card, the card returns to the zone it came from. Each player may also reverse any legal resource payments that player activated while making the il egal play. Players may not reverse actions that moved cards to a deck, moved cards from a deck to any zone other than Standby, caused a deck to be shuffled, or caused cards from a deck to be revealed. 

708.2. When reversing il egal cards and effects, the player who had priority retains it and may take another action or pass. The player may redo the reversed action in a legal way or take any other action al owed by the rules.

These rules may limit the use of some cards, including barring some or al cards from specific sets \(see rule 100.6\). 

Trap – Traps are a subtype of Accessory. During your Primary Phase, you may set a Trap from your hand face down into your Accessory Zone. Setting is not the same as playing. There is no limit to the number of Traps you may set in a turn. Setting a Trap does not have a resource cost \(see rule 304\).

Unrivaled – A card with Unrivaled has the fol owing effect, “Only one card with Unrivaled is al owed per deck” \(see rule 704.15\). 

Weapon – Weapon are a subtype of Accessory. Weapons can only be played and/or attached during your own Primary Phase. A Weapon’s attach cost is color specific and must be paid to attach that Weapon to a Clash card you control. Attach costs of Weapons are activated effects. 

Only one Weapon may be attached to a Clash card at any given time unless otherwise stated. 

\(see rule 305\). 

Winning the game – There are several ways to win the game \(see rule 104.3\). 

X – Many objects use the letter \[X\] as a placeholder for a number that needs to be determined. 

Some objects have effects or abilities that define the value of \[X\]; the rest let their control er choose the value of \[X\] \(see rule 107.3\). 

Zone – A zone is a place where objects can be during a game. There are normal y nine zones: Contender Zone, Clash Zone, Clashground Zone, Accessory Zone, Resource Zone, Oblivion, Standby, hand, and deck. Each player has their own Contender Zone, Clash Zone, Clashground Zone, Accessory Zone, Resource Zone, Oblivion, hand, and deck \(see rule 400\). 

Zone-change triggers – Trigger events that involve objects changing zones are cal ed “zone-change triggers.” Many effects with zone-change triggers attempt to do something to that object after it changes zones \(see rule 603.6\). 





Appendix B: Clarified Card Reference \(Errata\) Cards as they appear in the Alpha Clash Trading Card Game represent the correct text, characteristics, and intent of that card design. For the exact wording of a card, reference the official card database at alphaclashtcg.com. However, mistakes do happen and clarification and/or rewording is necessary to facilitate an enjoyable experience and fair gameplay. The adjusted text of a card is known as an errata. 

For the cards listed below, ignore the written text as shown on the card and apply this adjusted phrasing. Errata text replaces any outdated text \(for the card in the indicated printed set\) and represents the correct wording and intent of the card. Final y, in an effort to reduce the reliance on this Appendix, future sets may include reprints of the cards listed below WITH their errata text applied. 



ERRATA for “Set 1 – The Awakening” 

● Earthly Barricade \(AC1-069\) 

Counter - Attack: Choose target Clash card you control. Prevent the next two clash damage that would be dealt to it this turn, then your Contender gains two health. 

● T-Bone, the Vindictive \(AC1-076\) 

Counter - Play: You may only activate this effect when an opponent plays a Clashground. You may send this card to Oblivion. If you do, return the Clashground being played to its owner's hand. It does not enter play.
