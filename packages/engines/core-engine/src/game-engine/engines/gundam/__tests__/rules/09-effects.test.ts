/**
 * Tests for LLM-RULES Section 9: Effect Activation and Resolution
 *
 * These tests validate the effect system mechanics covering five effect types:
 * 1. Constant effects - Always active while in location
 * 2. Triggered effects - Activate on specific conditions
 * 3. Activated effects - Player-activated freely
 * 4. Command effects - Activate when Command card played
 * 5. Substitution effects - Replace one event with another
 *
 * Rules covered:
 * - 9-1: Effect types and activation conditions
 * - 9-1-5: Constant effects remain active continuously
 * - 9-1-6: Triggered effects activate on conditions
 * - 9-1-7: Activated effects can be freely activated
 * - 9-1-8: Command effects activate when played
 * - 9-1-9: Substitution effects replace events
 * - 9-2: Effect conditions and target requirements
 * - 9-3: Effect activation steps and priority order
 *
 * Priority Order: Active player → Standby player
 * Target selection is required before effect activation
