/**
 * Integration Tests for Multi-Player Priority Handling
 *
 * These tests validate priority mechanics, turn order, action step priority,
 * and player interaction timing in multi-player scenarios.
 *
 * Test Coverage:
 * - Action step turn order (standby player priority)
 * - Multiple players passing consecutively
 * - Standby player having priority first in action steps
 * - Active player priority during main phase
 * - Priority passing mechanics
 * - Turn player transitions
 * - Effect resolution priority between players
 *
 * Real Cards Used:
 * - ST01-001 (Gundam RX-78-2): 3/3/4 with Repair 2
 * - ST01-005 (GM): 1/2/2 basic unit
 * - ST01-008 (Demi Trainer): 1/1/1 with Blocker
 * - ST01-010 (Amuro Ray): Pilot with Burst effect
 *
 * Rules References:
 * - LLM-RULES Section 8: Action Steps (priority mechanics)
 * - LLM-RULES Section 6-4: Main Phase (active player priority)
 * - LLM-RULES Section 9-4: Effect System (resolution order by priority)
 * - LLM-RULES Section 7: Combat (action step during combat)
