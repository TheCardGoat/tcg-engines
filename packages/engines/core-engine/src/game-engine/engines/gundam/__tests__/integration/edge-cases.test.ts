/**
 * Integration Tests for Edge Cases
 *
 * These tests validate unusual game states, boundary conditions, and edge cases
 * that may occur during gameplay but are less common than standard scenarios.
 *
 * Test Coverage:
 * - Zone limits reached (battle area, hand, resource area, shield section)
 * - Multiple simultaneous effects triggering at once
 * - Effect resolution order conflicts and priority handling
 * - Empty zone scenarios (no cards in critical zones)
 * - Maximum capacity scenarios (zones at their limits)
 * - Unusual timing windows and game state transitions
 * - Corner cases in rule enforcement
 *
 * Real Cards Used:
 * - ST01-001 (Gundam RX-78-2): 3/3/4 with Repair 2
 * - ST01-005 (GM): 1/2/2 basic unit
 * - ST01-008 (Demi Trainer): 1/1/1 with Blocker
 * - ST02-001 (Wing Gundam): 4/4/5 with Breach 5
 *
 * Rules References:
 * - LLM-RULES Section 3: Game Locations (zone limits)
 * - LLM-RULES Section 9: Effect System (resolution order)
 * - LLM-RULES Section 10: Rules Management (automatic processes)
 * - LLM-RULES Section 11: Keyword Effects
