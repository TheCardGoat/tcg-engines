/**
 * Tests for LLM-RULES Section 1: Game Overview
 *
 * These tests validate:
 * 1-2-1: Win conditions - when opponent is defeated, the other player wins
 * 1-2-2-1: Defeat by damage - player receives battle damage with no shields
 * 1-2-2-2: Defeat by deck out - player has no cards remaining in deck
 * 1-2-3: Players may concede at any time
 * 1-3-1: Card effects override fundamental rules when contradictory
 *
 * Note: Some tests are structured to validate rule framework even when
 * specific mechanics (like attack resolution) are not fully implemented yet.
