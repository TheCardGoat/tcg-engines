# Gap Analysis Component

This component analyzes the current gaps between import data and the improved type system to provide recommendations for enhancements.

## Purpose

- Analyze import data structure and field usage patterns
- Compare current type definitions with actual data requirements
- Parse game rules to identify missing mechanics
- Generate comprehensive gap analysis reports with actionable recommendations

## Key Interfaces

- `GapAnalyzer` - Main interface for gap analysis functionality
- `ImportDataAnalyzer` - Analyzes JSON import files and catalogs field patterns
- `TypeSystemAnalyzer` - Parses existing type definitions and identifies gaps
- `GameRulesAnalyzer` - Extracts game mechanics from RULES.md
- `GapAnalysisReportGenerator` - Creates comprehensive reports with recommendations

## Usage

The gap analysis component should be run first in the conversion pipeline to identify what improvements are needed in the type system before attempting conversion.

```typescript
const gapAnalyzer = new GapAnalyzer(config);
const report = await gapAnalyzer.generateGapReport();
// Use report to enhance type system before conversion
```

## Output

Generates detailed reports identifying:
- Missing fields in current type system
- Unused or incorrectly typed fields
- Missing game mechanics that need type representation
- Prioritized recommendations for type system improvements
