Riftbound Core Rules 

Last Updated: 2025-06-02 



000. Golden and Silver Rules 

**001. **

## **Golden Rule **

002. 

Card text supersedes rules text. Whenever a card fundamentally contradicts the rules, the card's indication is what is true. 

**050. **

## **Silver Rule **

051. 

Card text uses different terminology than rules. Card text should be interpreted according to these rules, not as though it were text within these rules. 

052. 

**Card**, when written in card effects, is shorthand for " **Main Deck** card." Runes, legends, and battlefields are not considered cards when executing the abilities and effects of game objects. They are considered cards for the purposes of these rules. 

053. 

Cards refer to themselves in the first person. 

053.1. 

Units and legends say "I," "me," etc. 

053.2. 

Gear and spells say "this." 

053.3. 

Battlefields say "here." 

100. Game Concepts 

**101. **

## **Deck Construction **

102. 

Riftbound is a Trading Card Game where a player must provide their own cards to play against other players. 

103. 

To play Riftbound, a player must have two **Decks, ** a **Champion Legend**, and a number of **Battlefields** determined by the **Mode of Play. ** 

103.1. 

1 **Champion Legend** 

103.1.a. 

This is placed in the **Legend Zone** at the start of the game. 

103.1.b. 

This will dictate the **Domain Identity** of the **Main Deck. ** 

103.1.b.1. 

Cards included in your **Deck** must abide by your **Domain Identity. ** 

103.1.b.2. 

This can be **Domain**, **Type**, **Tag**, or any other attribute. 

103.1.b.3. 

If a card has a single **Domain**, then that card is permitted in the **Domain** **Identity** that corresponds to the same **Domain. ** 

103.1.b.4. 

If a card has more than one **Domain**, then that card is permitted only in a **Domain Identity** that contains all of the indicated **Domains** on that card. 





103.2. 

**A Main Deck of at least 40 cards **

1 Chosen Champion Unit 

Units 

Gear 

Spells 

103.2.a. 

## **Chosen Champion**

103.2.a.1. 

This will be placed in the **Champion Zone** at the start of the game. 

103.2.a.2. 

Must be a champion unit with a champion tag that matches the tag on your **Champion Legend. **

Example: Loose Cannon has the tag Jinx. Therefore, a player could choose Jinx, Rebel or Jinx, Demolitionist as their **Chosen Champion**, because they also have the tag Jinx. 



Example: Tibbers has the tag Annie, but it is a signature unit, not a champion unit. It cannot be your **Chosen Champion**, even if your **Champion Legend** has the tag Annie. 

103.2.b. 

Your **Main Deck** can include up to 3 copies of the same named card. 

103.2.b.1. 

This includes your **Chosen Champion. **

Example: A deck could include Volibear, Furious as its **Chosen** **Champion** and still include 2 more copies of Volibear, Furious. ** **

103.2.b.2. 

Cards have different names even if they represent the same character. 

Example: A deck could include 3 copies of Yasuo, Remorseful and 3 

copies of Yasuo, Windrider, because they have different names. 

103.2.c. 

Subject to **Domain Identity. ** 

103.2.d. 

Your deck may only contain 3 total **Signature** cards that have the same Champion tag as your **Champion Legend. ** 

103.2.d.1. 

Regardless of name, a deck may only contain a sum total of 3 Signature cards. 

103.2.d.2. 

All of the Signature cards must have the Champion tag that corresponds to the **Champion Legend** of the deck. 

103.2.d.3. 

Signature cards are not Champion units and cannot be placed in the **Champion Zone**. 

103.2.e. 

During Gameplay, the **Main Deck** is **Private Information. ** 

103.2.e.1. 

It cannot be looked through or revealed unless instructed by a card effect. 

103.3. 

## **Rune Deck**

103.3.a. 

12 **Rune Cards** 

103.3.a.1. 

Cards in this deck must be of the **Domain Identity** of your **Chosen** **Champion. ** 

103.3.b. 

Must be shuffled and kept separate from the **Main Deck. ** 



103.4. 

## **Battlefields**

103.4.a. 

The number will be dictated by your **Mode of Play. ** 

103.4.b. 

Subject to **Domain Identity. ** 

**104. **

126. 

## **Ownership**

For gameplay purposes, a card's **Owner** is the player who brought it into the game, either as their **Champion Legend**, one of their **Battlefields**, or part of their **Main Deck** or **Rune Deck**. 

The legal owner of a card doesn't matter during gameplay. 

Example: Bo didn't bring a deck, so Alice loans him a deck. During the game, Bo is considered the owner of those cards, even though legally they belong to Alice. 

127. 

## **Privacy**

127.1. 

A card will always exist in one of the many **Zones** described during **Setup. ** 

127.2. 

A card will have a different level of **Privacy** based on where it resides at a given time 127.3. 

**Secret:** This level of Privacy indicates that neither player may read or look at the face of the card. 

127.4. 

**Private:** This level of Privacy indicates that only the controller of a card on the board or the owner of a card in any other zone may read or look at the face of the card. 

Example: Cards in a player's hand are owned by that player. Only that player may read or look at their faces. 



Example: If a player controls a facedown card at a battlefield, that player and only that player may read or look at that card's face, regardless of who owns that card. 

127.5. 

**Public:** This level of Privacy indicates that any player may read or look at the face of the card. 

128. 

## **Back Side**

128.1. 

The back side of a card is the side with the **Riftbound** logo. 

128.2. 

There is a unique pattern of back side for each of the three categories of card: **Main Deck** cards, **Rune Deck** cards, and **Battlefields** and **Champion Legends. ** 

128.3. 

The back side of a card is presented to conceal information for **Private** and **Secret** information cards. For example, cards in the **Main Deck** and cards in hand have their back side presented. 

128.4. 

The term **facedown** is used to describe the state during regular play of having a card's back side presented on the Board. A facedown card’s front side is considered **Private** **Information. ** 

129. 

## **Front Side**

129.1. 

The front side of a card is the opposite of its back. 

129.2. 

This is also referred to as a **front face. ** 

129.3. 

This can be identified in situations where the back is not easily discernible by the presence of the **Play Cost** in the upper left corner of the card. 

129.4. 

Cards, when played, are played with their front face presented. 



129.5. 

The term **face up** is used to describe the state during regular play of having a card's front face presented 

129.6. 

Cards are considered to be **Public Information** while in this state, even if obscured by other cards in a pile. 

Example: The Trash is **Public Information** because all cards there have their front face presented even while stacked. 

130. 

## **Cost**

130.1. 

**Main Deck** cards have a **Cost**, listed in the upper left corner of the front face of the card. 

See **rule 158. Rune Pools** for more information.

**Energy** Cost 

130.2.a. 

The numeral listed in the **Cost** element in the upper left corner of the card. 

130.3. 

**Power** cost 

130.3.a. 

The symbols, listed vertically, in the **Cost** element in the upper left corner of the card. 

130.3.b. 

This section may not be present on every card. 

131. 

## **Name**

131.1. 

Each card has a name that identifies it uniquely. 

131.2. 

This is usually located in the middle of the card. 

131.3. 

Cards that are printed in different languages but represent the same card are considered to have the same name for the purposes of deckbuilding and gameplay. 

Example: Chemtech Enforcer in English and its counterpart in Chinese are considered the same card, despite the **Name** element on the card reading differently. 

132. 

## **Category**

132.1. 

A card can have one or more **Categories** and **Sub-Categories** based on the properties of its front and back sides. 

132.2. 

These **Categories** and **Sub-Categories** dictate the behaviors of the card during play. 

132.3. 

Spells and other effects can refer to categories, sub-categories, card types, tags, and other characteristics inclusively or exclusively. 

Example: A "non-unit card" is any card that is not a unit. 



Example: A "unit" is any game object that is a unit, regardless of any other categories it belongs to.

140.1.c. 

This action cannot be performed during a **Showdown. ** 

140.2. 

**Exhausting** the **Unit** is the **Cost** for this action. 

140.3. 

Players may perform multiple **Units' ** standard move simultaneously. 

140.3.a. 

When a **Move** like this is declared by a player, the units' **Destination** must be the same. 

140.3.b. 

When a **Move** like this is declared by a player, the **Origins** do not need to be the same. 

140.3.c. 

The **Costs** of **Exhausting** the **Units** are also paid **Simultaneously. ** 

140.4. 

The Destinations where **Units** can **Move** to with their **Standard Move** are restricted: 140.4.a. 

**Units** may move from their **Base** to a **Battlefield. ** 

140.4.a.1. 

**Units cannot Move** to a **Battlefield** that already has units from 2 other players present. 

140.4.b. 

**Units** may move from a **Battlefield** to their **Base. ** 

140.4.c. 

**Ganking** is a unique ability that affects a **Unit's** **Standard Move** 140.4.c.1. 

**Units** with **Ganking** may use their **Standard Move** to **Move** from **Battlefield** to **Battlefield. **

See **rule 722. Ganking** for more information. 

141. 

**Units** may have **Activated** **Abilities. ** 

141.1. 

**Activated Abilities** are **Game Effects** that are written as **Costs** followed by a ":", and then succeeded by an effect. 

See **rule 576. Activated Abilities **for more information. 

141.2. 

The **Activated Ability** of **Units** may be executed at any time during the controlling player's **Action Phase** during an **Open State**, and not during a **Showdown. ** 

141.2.a. 

This follows the same process as playing a card. 

See **rule 554. Playing Cards** for more information. 

141.2.a.1. 

This behaves, once activated, like a spell without an associated card. 

**142. **

## **Gear **



143. 

**Gear** are: 

143.1. 

A **Game Object** 

143.1.a. 

While on **the Board. ** 

143.1.a.1. 

**Gear** can only be played to a player's **Base. ** 

143.1.a.2. 

**Gear** and their details are Public Information while on **the Board. ** 

143.1.a.3. 

**Gear** can be chosen, affected, or manipulated by spells, effects, or game actions that specify **Gear. ** 

143.1.a.4. 

**Gear** can be **Killed. **

See **rule 604. Kill** for more information. ** **

143.1.b. 

While in the **Trash** 

143.1.b.1. 

**Gear** are treated as **Cards** before **Game Objects**, similar to the **Hand. ** 

143.1.b.2. 

They retain the properties of being **Gear**, but are not on **the Board** and thus cannot take actions or be affected by spells, abilities, or game actions that affect **Gear** on **the Board. ** 

143.1.b.3. 

**Gear** can be affected by spells and game effects that affect **Gear** in the **Trash. ** 

143.2. 

A Card Type 

143.2.a. 

This is a unique identifier that some spells or abilities will use to restrict what they can choose or affect. 

143.2.b. 

The card type is relevant in all zones. 

144. 

**Gear** have several **Intrinsic Properties** unique to them. 

144.1. 

**Gear** enters play **Ready. ** 

144.2. 

**Gear** can only be played to a player's **Base. ** 

144.3. 

If a **Gear** is at a **Battlefield** for any reason, then it is immediately recalled to its controller's **Base** as a corrective action. 

See **rule 616. Recalls** for more information. 

145. 

**Gear** may have **Activated** **Abilities. ** 

145.1. 

**Activated Abilities** are **Game Effects** that are written as **Costs** followed by a ":", and then succeeded by an effect. 

See **rule 576. Activated Abilities** for more information. 

145.2. 

The **Activated Ability** of **Gear** may be executed at any time during the controlling player's **Action Phase** during an **Open State**, and not during a **Showdown. ** 

145.2.a. 

This follows the same process as playing a card. 

See **rule 554. Playing Cards** for more information. 

145.2.a.1. 

This behaves, once activated, like a spell without an associated card. 



**146. **

## **Spells **

147. 

Spell is a card type. 

148. 

A spell can be played during an **Open State** **Outside of Showdowns** on its controller's turn. 

149. 

A spell is controlled by the player who played it. 

150. 

A spell creates a game effect according to its instructions and is then placed in the **Trash** of the player who owns it. 

151. 

When a spell is successfully played, a player executes the rules text of the spell. This is called **Resolving** the spell. 

151.1. 

Spells have their rules text executed from top to bottom when they are **Resolved. ** 

151.2. 

If a later part of a spell applies a **Replacement Effect** that alters earlier parts of the spell, apply those replacement effects as appropriate. 

Example: A spell says "Choose a unit. Kill it the next time it takes damage this turn." 

and "\[Legion\] — Kill it now instead. \(Get the effect if you've played another card this turn.\)" If the Legion condition is satisfied, the unit is killed immediately and the instruction to kill it the next time it takes damage is ignored, even if the unit remains on the board somehow. 

151.3. 

While a spell is **Resolving**, nothing else may intercede or be **Resolved**, including triggered abilities or game effects that would occur as a result of the execution of the spell. 

151.3.a. 

Finish resolving al effects of a spell before addressing anything the spell may have triggered or caused through execution. 

152. 

Certain **Keywords** on spells are not executable rules text, but instead intrinsic properties of the spell. 

152.1. 

These determine inherent properties and behaviors of the spell before being played or while on the chain. 

152.2. 

These keywords are: 

152.2.a. 

## **Action**

152.2.a.1. 

This indicates that, in addition to being able to be played during an **Open** **State**, this spell may also be played during **Open States** during **Showdowns. ** 

152.2.b. 

## **Reaction**

152.2.b.1. 

Grants all cases and rules of **Action. ** 

152.2.b.2. 

In addition to all prior cases, may also be played during **all forms of Closed** **State. ** 

152.2.b.3. 

This will result in this spell resolving before spells and abilities that are already on the chain. 

**153. **

## **Runes **

154. 

**Rune** is a **Card Type. ** 

154.1. 

A **Rune** is not a **Main Deck** card. 



154.1.a. 

This means, despite remaining on **the Board** until **Recycled** or otherwise removed from the board, it is not a **Permanent. ** 

154.2. 

**Runes** are kept in the **Rune Deck. ** 

154.2.a. 

Exactly 12 **Rune** cards chosen during Deck Construction. 

See **rule 103.3. Rune Deck** for more information. 

154.2.b. 

When a **Rune** is **Recycled** it is returned to the **Rune Deck**, not the **Main Deck. **

See **rule 594. Recycle** for more information. 

155. 

**Runes** produce the resources needed to pay costs. 

156. 

**Runes** produce **Energy** and **Power. ** 

156.1. 

**Energy** is used to pay numeric **Energy costs. ** 

156.1.a. 

**Energy** has no Domain. 

156.1.b. 

**Energy** has no type. 

156.2. 

**Power** is used to pay Domain-associated **Power Costs. ** 

156.2.a. 

**Power** has a Domain. 

156.2.a.1. 

**Power**'s Domain usually corresponds to the Domain of the **Rune** that produced it. 

156.2.b. 

Some **Power** is **Universal** and can be used to pay for costs of any Domain. 

157. 

**Basic** **Runes** 

157.1. 

There are six **Basic Runes**, each with a Domain corresponding to its name: Fury Rune 

Calm Rune 

Mind Rune 

Body Rune 

Chaos Rune 

Order Rune 

157.2. 

A **Basic Rune** always has the following two **Abilities**: 157.2.a. 

\[T\]: Add \[1\]. 

157.2.b. 

**Recycle this**: Add \[C\]. 

157.2.b.1. 

The **Power** added this way corresponds to the **Domain** of the **Rune** that is being **Recycled. ** 

158. 

Rune Pools 

159. 

The **Rune Pool** is a conceptual collection of a player's available **Energy** and **Power** available to pay **Costs. ** 

159.1. 

When a card adds **Energy** or **Power, ** it is added to the controlling player's **Rune Pool**. 

159.2. 

Players must first add **Energy** and **Power** to their **Rune Pool** in order to be able to spend it to play cards or pay for **Abilities** with costs. 



159.3. 

**Energy** and **Power** do not have a physical marker or tracker, although players may wish to use a physical tracker if they are retaining unspent **Energy** and **Power** over the course of their turn. 

160. 

Every player's **Rune Pool** empties at the end of each player's draw phase and the end of each player's turn. 

160.1. 

Any unspent **Energy** or **Power** are lost. 

161. 

All **Abilities** that include the action " **Add**" are abilities that are adding **Energy** or **Power** to the **Rune** **Pool. **

See **rule 605. Add** for more information. 

**162. **

## **Battlefields **

163. 

**Battlefields** are **Game Objects. **

163.6. 

Any number of **Units** can be present at a **Battlefield. ** 

163.7. 

**Battlefields** can be targeted by spells or game effects. 

163.8. 

**Battlefields** can have **Passive Abilities. **

See **rule 567. Passive Abilities **for more information. ** **

163.9. 

**Battlefields** can have **Triggered Abilities. **

See **rule 582. Triggered Abilities **for more information. ** **

164. 

**Battlefields** are not **Permanents. ** 

165.

169.1. 

The **Legend** determines the **Domain Identity** of cards its owner can include. 

See **rule 101. Deck Construction** for more information. 

**170. **

## **Tokens **

171. 

**Tokens** are **Game Objects** created by spells and abilities during play. 

172. 

Tokens can be represented by anything. Printed tokens are included in **Riftbound** booster packs, but they are not required to play a token. 

173. 

A token's **controller** is the controller of the spell or ability that created it, unless the token's type innately determines control or that spell or ability specifies that a different player is the token's controller. 

174. 

A token's **owner** is the player who controlled the effect that created it. 

175. 

The effect that creates a token may specify the conditions or circumstances under which it enters the board. These stipulations may alter the usual steps for playing a card. 

175.1. 

The effect may state that the token enters ready or exhausted, if that state is contrary to the default for the token's type. 

175.2. 

The effect may restrict the location to which the token may be played. 

175.3. 

The effect may grant temporary abilities or modifications to the token. 

176. 

Tokens are not cards. 

176.1. 

Tokens have some properties in common with cards. 

176.1.a. 

Tokens are **played** by their owner if their card type is played, following all the applicable steps for playing a card plus any restrictions or modifications from the effect that created the token. 



See **rule 554. Playing Cards** for more information. 

176.1.b. 

Token units have a **Might**. 

176.1.c. 

Tokens may have one or more **tags**. 

176.1.d. 

Tokens have a **type**. They follow all rules for their type unless otherwise specified. 

Example: A token unit is a unit. It enters exhausted, can take the standard move action, deals damage equal to its Might in combat, is destroyed if it takes damage equal to or greater than its might, can be chosen or otherwise affected by spells or abilities that choose or affect units, etc. 

176.2. 

Tokens differ from cards in some ways. 

176.2.a. 

Tokens do not have **costs**. 

176.2.b. 

Tokens do not have **domains**. 

177. 

Tokens are created on the board and cannot exist elsewhere. 

177.1. 

If a token is put into any **Non-Board Zone**, it ceases to exist immediately after moving to its new zone. 

178. 

The spell or ability that creates a token specifies some of its characteristics. It may have other characteristics, as listed below. 

178.1. 

A **1\[S\] Recruit token** is a domainless unit token with 1 Might and the Recruit tag. 

178.2. 

A **3\[S\] Sprite token with Temporary** is a domainless unit token with 3 Might, the Fae tag, and the **Temporary** keyword. 

See **rule 728. Temporary** for more information. 

**179. **

## **Control **

180. 

**Control** is the concept of a player having influence of a **Game Object** and applies differently to different card types. 

181. 

## **Battlefields**

181.1. 

**Control** is established over **Battlefields** through the course of play. 

181.2. 

**Control** is a binary state for **Battlefields** and an **Identifier** for players. 

181.2.a. 

A **Battlefield** is **Controlled** or **Uncontrolled. ** 

181.2.b. 

A **Battlefield** is **Controlled by a specific player** or **Controlled by no one. ** 

181.3. 

**Control** can be **Contested** through the course of play. 

181.3.a. 

**Contested** is a temporary status applied to the battlefield when a **Unit** controlled by a **Player** who does not currently **Control** that **Battlefield** **Moves** or otherwise becomes present there. 

181.3.b. 

A **Battlefield** remains **Contested** until **Control** is established or re-established. 



181.3.c. 

The state of a **Battlefield** being **Contested** is used to determine when **Combat** should occur, when a **Showdown** without a **Combat** should occur, and when **Control** will change. 

181.3.d. 

At this time **Game Effects** cannot reference this status**. ** 

181.4. 

**Control** is established by the presence of **Units** controlled by a player. 

181.4.a. 

If a player controls **Units** at a **Battlefield, ** outside of **Combat**, they have **Control** of that **Battlefield. ** 

181.4.b. 

A player maintains control of a **Battlefield** while it is being **Contested** by an opponent. 

181.4.c. 

**Control** changes immediately if, at the end of **Combat**, the **Units** at a **Battlefield** are controlled by a different player than before the **Combat. ** 

181.4.d. 

If a player has no **Units** at a **Battlefield, ** they have no **Control** of that **Battlefield. ** 

181.5. 

**Control** is a constant state with no reliance on timing. 

182. 

## **Everything Else**

182.1. 

When a player **Plays** a **Card**, they are established as that **Game Object's** **Controller. ** 

182.2. 

For **Spells**, they are the **Spell's Controller. ** 

182.2.a. 

That player chooses targets. 

182.2.b. 

That player chooses modes. 

182.2.c. 

That player pays costs. 

182.3. 

For **Permanents** and **Runes**, when they **Enter the Board**, that player is assigned as that **Game Object's** **Controller. ** 

182.3.a. 

That player may make decisions about the **Game Object's Inherent Abilities. ** 

182.3.b. 

That player may make decisions about the **Game Object's Unique Abilities. ** 

182.3.c. 

That player may make decisions about any game effects or decisions necessary while the card is being played. 

182.3.d. 

That player may make decisions about any game effects created from "When you play me" effects of **Permanents. ** 

183. 

When a game effect or rules text refers to the **Controller** of a specific object, it can be referring to either context interchangeably. 

183.1. 

The method of assignment of control is different, but the status of **Control** is the same across all **Game Objects. ** 

500. Playing the Game 

**501. **

## **The Turn **



502. 

Play continues cyclically until one player wins. 

503. 

The phases of a turn are rigid, but the actions taken during those steps can be done in any order, unless otherwise specified. 

503.1. 

**Game Actions** of any nature are performed one at a time, and are executed completely . 

503.2. 

**Game Actions** cannot be performed simultaneously for any reason. 

503.2.a. 

If one or more actions, game effects, or **Triggered Abilities** are activated simultaneously, then **Turn Order** is referenced to organize the sequence of actions. 

See **rule 582. Triggered Abilities** for more information. 

504. 

The **Turn Player** is the player taking the current turn. 

505. 

When there are no items on the **Chain** and the **Turn Player** cannot or chooses not to perform any **Discretionary Actions**, the current phase or step of the turn ends and the next phase, step, or turn begins. 

506. 

The **Turn Player** changes when the current **Turn Player** reaches the **End** of all of the **Phases** of their **Turn. ** 

507. 

States of the Turn 

508. 

At any given time, the turn is in either a **Neutral State** or a **Showdown State. ** 

508.1. 

If a **Showdown** is in progress, the turn is in a **Showdown State. ** 

508.1.a. 

Only cards and abilities with the **Action** or **Reaction** keywords can be played or activated in a **Showdown State. ** 

508.2. 

If no **Showdown** is in progress, the turn is in a **Neutral State. ** 

509. 

At any given time, the turn is in either an **Open State** or a **Closed State. ** 

509.1. 

If a **Chain** exists, the turn is in a **Closed State. ** 

509.1.a. 

Only cards and abilities with the **Reaction** keyword can be played or activated in a **Closed State. ** 

509.2. 

If no **Chain** exists, the turn is in an **Open State. ** 

510. 

These descriptions can be combined, such that the turn is always in one of these four states: 510.1. 

**Neutral Open:** There is no **Showdown** in progress and no **Chain** exists. 

510.1.a. 

By default, cards can be played and abilities activated only when a player has priority on their turn in a **Neutral Open** state. 

510.2. 

**Neutral Closed:** There is no **Showdown** in progress and a **Chain** exists. 

510.3. 

**Showdown Open:** A **Showdown** is in progress and no **Chain** exists. 

510.4. 

**Showdown Closed:** A **Showdown** is in progress and a **Chain** exists. 

511. 

Priority and Focus 

512. 

At any given time, up to one player has **Priority. ** 



512.1. 

**Priority** is the permission to take **Discretionary Actions. **

See **rule 589.1. Discretionary Actions** for more information. ** **

512.1.a. 

The player with **Priority** can take appropriately timed **Discretionary Actions. ** 

512.1.b. 

If no player has **Priority**, no player can take **Discretionary Actions. ** 

512.1.b.1. 

Players can always take and make choices for **Limited Actions** when instructed, regardless of **Priority. ** 

512.2. 

A player receives **Priority** at the following times: 

512.2.a. 

When the turn is in a **Neutral Open State** during their **Action Phase. ** 

512.2.b. 

When the turn is in a **Showdown State** and they gain **Focus. ** 

512.2.c. 

When the turn is in a **Closed State** and they control the next item on the **Chain. ** 

512.2.d. 

When the turn is in a **Closed State**, they are the next **Relevant Player** in **Turn Order**, and the player with **Priority** passes. 

513. 

At any given time, up to one player has **Focus. ** 

513.1. 

**Focus** is the permission to take appropriately timed **Discretionary Actions** when the turn is in a **Showdown Open State. **

See **rule 507. States of the Turn** for more information. ** **

513.1.a. 

The player with **Focus** must obey any additional restrictions on which **Discretionary** **Actions** may be performed. 

Example: A player with **Focus** may not play spells or activate abilities that don't have the **Action** or **Reaction** keywords. 

513.2. 

A player who gains **Focus** also gains **Priority. ** 

513.3. 

A player who passes **Priority** retains **Focus. ** 

513.4. 

If the turn is in a **Neutral State**, no player has **Focus. ** 

514.

This is denoted as a **Neutral** **Open State**, and only the **Turn Player** has the ability to play spells or activate abilities. 

See **rule 507. States of the Turn** for more information. 

516.2.b.1. 

In **Modes of Play** with teammates, the **Turn Player's** teammates may play spells and activate abilities, including ones without **Action** or **Reaction. ** 

516.2.c. 

In **Modes of Play** with Teammates, spells may be played by Teammates of the **Turn** **Player** during this time, but the actions of the **Turn Player** take precedence. 

516.3. 

As a result of a player taking **Discretionary Actions**, one or more structured phases may occur. 



516.4. 

## **Combat**

516.4.a. 

A **Combat** phase occurs as a result of **Units** controlled by opposing players being present at the same **Battlefield**. 

516.4.b. 

This could be the result of a **Standard Move Standard Action**, a **Spell**, or other **Game Effect. ** 

516.4.c. 

The source effect does not change the structure or flow of **Combat** once initiated. 

516.4.d. 

A **Combat** can only occur between two players. 

See **rule 620. Combat** for more information. 

516.4.e. 

Play proceeds following the steps of combat. 

See **rule 624. Steps of Combat **for more information. 

516.4.f. 

Combat will also include a **Showdown. ** 

516.5. 

## **Showdowns**

516.5.a. 

A **Showdown** occurs when a **Combat** occurs. 

516.5.a.1. 

Showdowns that occur as a result of Combat are a **Sub-Phase** of **Combat. ** 

516.5.b. 

A **Showdown** occurs when one or more **Units** move to an empty battlefield. 

516.5.b.1. 

Showdowns that occur as a result of a player moving to an empty **Battlefield** are a stand-alone **Phase** and do not create a **Combat. ** 

516.5.c. 

A **Showdown** is a structured **Window of Opportunity** where **Relevant Players** may play cards and activate abilities with **Action** or **Reaction. **

See **rule 545. Showdowns **for more information. ** **

516.6. 

When a player has no more **Discretionary Actions** they wish to execute, they must indicate they are ending their turn. 

516.6.a. 

This ends the **Action Phase. ** 

516.6.b. 

Play proceeds to the **End of Turn. ** 

517. 

End of Turn Phase 

517.1. 

Ending Step 

517.1.a. 

At the end of the turn **Game Effects** take place. 

517.1.b. 

Specific game effects and abilities will reference this timing and phase as necessary. 

517.2. 

Expiration Step 

517.2.a. 

Clear all marked damage from all **Units** at all **Locations. ** 

517.2.b. 

All "this turn" effects expire simultaneously. 

517.2.c. 

As the **Expiration Step** ends, all players' **Rune Pools** empty. Any unspent **Energy** and **Power** are lost. 

517.3. 

Cleanup Step 



517.3.a. 

Perform a **Cleanup. ** 

517.4. 

If **Game Effects** have applied any damage or generated any additional "this turn" effects, return to the Expiration Step and continue this process. 

517.5. 

The **Turn Player** then becomes the next player in **Turn Order. ** 

**518. **

## **Cleanups **

519. 

A **Cleanup** occurs: 

After an item on the **Chain** resolves. 

After a **Move** completes. 

After a **Showdown** completes. 

After a **Combat** completes. 

520. 

All **Units** who have had non-zero **Damage** marked on them equalling or exceeding their **Might** are killed and placed in their owners' **Trash. ** 

521. 

Remove the "Attacker" or "Defender" status from **Units** no longer present at a **Battlefield** where a **Combat** is currently occurring. 

522. 

Recognize and begin execution of all state-based **Game Effects** currently outstanding. 

522.1. 

These can be recognized by the phrases "While" or "As long as." 

523. 

Remove all **Hidden** cards from all **Battlefields** that do not also have a **Unit** controlled by the same player present and place them in their owner's **Trash. ** 

523.1. 

This can cause the **Battlefield** to become uncontrolled if this was not done as part of a **Conquer** step. 

524. 

Mark a **Combat** as **Pending** at each **Battlefield** with **Units** present from two opposing players. 

524.1. 

The **Combat** remains **Pending** at that **Battlefield** as long as there are **Units** present from two opposing players there. 

525. 

If the current state is a **Neutral Open State** and one or more **Battlefields** are **Contested** with no **Current Controller**, the **Turn Player** chooses one of those **Battlefields. ** A **Showdown** begins there. 

526. 

If the current state is a **Neutral Open** **State** and **Combat** is **Pending** at one or more **Battlefields**, the **Turn Player** chooses one of those **Battlefields**. **Combat** begins there. 

**527. **

## **Chains and Showdowns **

528. 

Relevant Players 

529. 

**Relevant Players** are players who can act during the following **Windows of Opportunity** that occur during the course of regular play: 

529.1. 

During a **Chain** 

529.2. 

During a **Showdown** 

530. 

Once a player becomes **Relevant**, they remain **Relevant** until the **Window of Opportunity** that caused the definition ends. 

530.1. 

The more-encompassing **Relevance** is used to determine this. 



Example: If a player becomes **Relevant** during a **Chain** inside of a **Showdown**, they remain **Relevant** until the **Showdown** ends, not the **Chain** that made them **Relevant. ** 

531. 

The following are **Relevant Players:** 

531.1. 

Players involved in the **Combat** currently occurring. 

531.1.a. 

If there is no **Combat** occurring, then **All Players** are relevant. 

531.2. 

Players who have been **Invited. ** 

531.2.a. 

The **Active Player** may choose another player **Not Currently Relevant** to the current **Chain** or **Showdown** to interact instead of themselves. This is considered a **Limited** **Action. **

531.2.a.1. 

The invited player may refuse the invitation. If they do, they do not become a **Relevant Player. ** 

531.2.a.2. 

If they accept the invitation, they must be able to, and consequently must, play a card or activate a **Game Object's** ability at the current timing. 

531.2.a.3. 

If they accept the invitation they become, and remain, a **Relevant Player** for the duration of this **Chain** or **Showdown. ** 

531.2.a.4. 

After the invited player plays a card or activates a legal ability, they become the **Active Player. ** 

532. 

Chains 

533. 

The **Chain** is a **Non-Board Zone** that temporarily exists whenever a card is played or an ability is activated. 

533.1. 

Cards are placed here as part of the process of being played. 

533.2. 

Abilities are queued here as part of the process of resolving. 

See **rule 564. Abilities **for more information. 

534. 

The **Chain** exists as long as a card or ability is on it. 

534.1. 

Only one **Chain** can exist at a time. 

534.2. 

If a card would begin to be played while a **Chain** already exists, it is placed on the existing **Chain. ** 

535. 

The **State** of the **Turn** is partially determined by whether or not the **Chain** currently exists. 

535.1. 

The turn is said to be in a **Closed State** if a **Chain** exists. 

535.1.a. 

Cards of all Categories, by default, cannot be played during a **Closed State. ** 

535.1.b. 

Card abilities, by default, cannot be played during a **Closed State. ** 

535.2. 

The turn is said to be in an **Open State** if no **Chain** exists. 

536. 

Steps of Resolving a Chain 

537. 

Whenever a card or token is played or an ability is activated, a **Chain** is created. 



537.1. 

The player that created the chain becomes the first **Active Player. ** 

537.2. 

The **Active Player** is a designator similar to, but distinct from, **Turn Player. ** 

537.3. 

Similar to the **Turn Player**, this designation will pass between players over the course of play. 

538. 

If the card that initiated the **Chain** was a permanent, no player receives priority before it resolves. 

Skip to **rule 543. **

539. 

Define or re-define **Relevant Players** to this chain. 

See **rule 528. Relevant Players** for more information. 

540. 

The **Active Player** may do any the following: 

540.1. 

**Play** a Spell that is **legally timed. ** 

540.1.a. 

**Spells**, by default, cannot be played during a **Closed State. ** 

540.1.a.1. 

A **Legally Timed** **Spell** would be a **Spell** with **Reaction. ** 

540.1.a.2. 

Other exceptions may be created during regular play. 

540.1.b. 

The spell will be added to the chain, following the steps of playing a card. 

540.1.b.1. 

This can be an additional spell to the one that **Started** the **Chain** in the case of the first **Active Player** after creating the **Chain. ** 

540.1.c. 

The spell will not be resolved until the end of the **Chain. ** 

540.2. 

**Activate** **Abilities** of **Game Objects** that are **legally timed. **

See **rule 564. Abilities** for more information. ** **

540.3. 

Invite a player to act. 

540.3.a. 

The invited player will become the **Active Player. ** 

540.4. 

## **Pass**

540.4.a. 

The **Active Player** passes to the next **Relevant Player** in **Turn Order. ** 

540.4.b. 

If all Relevant Players have passed once in sequence, nothing else can be added to the Chain and the Chain ends. Continue to **rule 542**. 

541. 

**Triggered Abilities** are added to the **Chain** if they are triggered by actions performed while a **Chain** is in progress. 

541.1. 

They are added as the most recent item on the **Chain. ** 

541.2. 

They do not affect the order of the **Active Player. ** 

541.3. 

If the controller of the **Triggered Ability** is not currently a **Relevant Player, ** they become a **Relevant Player. ** 

542. 

After an action is completed in **rule 540**, repeat **rule 539**. Continue until **rule 540.4.b. ** is accomplished, then continue to **rule 543. ** 

543. 

Resolve the **Chain. ** 



543.1. 

Identify the last spell or ability added to the **Chain** and execute its effect. 

543.1.a. 

After resolving, it is placed in the zone appropriate to its category. 

543.1.a.1. 

Spells are placed in their owner's trash. 

543.1.a.2. 

Permanents are placed on the board in the location chosen as part of the process of playing them. 

543.1.a.3. 

Abilities cease to exist. 

543.1.a.4. 

This is not a **Move. ** 

543.2. 

If there are any triggered abilities that trigger when a card is played, these trigger now. 

543.2.a. 

If there are other items on the **Chain** waiting to resolve, add any triggered abilities to the current **Chain** as the most recent item, as per **rule 541. **

543.2.b. 

If the item that resolved was the only item on the **Chain**, add any triggered abilities to a new **Chain. ** 

543.3. 

## **Perform a Cleanup. **

See **rule 518. Cleanups **for more information. ** **

543.4. 

**Return to rule 539. ** The player who controls the most recent item on the **Chain** becomes the **Active Player**, and all **Relevant Players** must pass again to proceed. 

544. 

Repeat until the **Chain** is empty of spells and/or card effects. 

545. 

Showdowns 

546. 

A **Showdown** is a **Window of Opportunity** in which **Relevant Players** have an **Open State** in which they may play **Spells** in an alternating fashion. 

546.1. 

Each spell played this way creates a **Chain** as normal. 

546.2. 

Players made **Relevant** remain so until the **Showdown** ends. 

547. 

The **State** of the turn is partially determined by whether or not a **Showdown** is in progress. 

547.1. 

The turn is said to be in a **Showdown State** if a **Showdown** is in progress. 

547.1.a. 

Cards of all Categories, by default, cannot be played during a **Showdown State. ** 

547.1.b. 

Card abilities, by default, cannot be played during a **Showdown State. ** 

547.2. 

The turn is said to be in a **Neutral State** if no **Showdown** is in progress. 

548. 

A **Showdown** begins when **Control** of a **Battlefield** is **Contested and the turn is in a Neutral Open** **State. ** 

548.1. 

If **Control** of a **Battlefield** is **Contested** between two players, then a **Showdown** will be opened as a step of **Combat. **

See **rule 620. Combat** for more information. ** **

548.2. 

If **Control** of a **Battlefield** is **Contested** and the **Battlefield** in question is uncontrolled when it becomes **Contested**, a **Showdown** is opened during the **Cleanup** at the end of that **Move. ** 



549. 

As a **Showdown** begins, the player who applied **Contested** status to the **Battlefield** gains **Focus. ** 

550. 

As a **Showdown** begins, the way it began defines initial **Relevant Players. ** 

550.1. 

If this **Showdown** is part of **Combat**, the **Attacking** and **Defending** players are the **Relevant** **Players** for this **Showdown. ** 

550.1.a. 

More players may become **Relevant** through the course of play. 

550.2. 

If this **Showdown** is not part of **Combat**, all players are **Relevant Players. ** 

551. 

When a **Showdown** begins, it may or may not begin with an **Initial Chain. ** 

551.1. 

**Showdowns** that open as a result of **Combat** have an **Initial Chain** of "When I attack" 

**Triggered Abilities** and/or "When I defend" **Triggered Abilities. ** 

551.1.a. 

These **Triggered Abilities** should be put on the chain first by the player with **Focus**, then following **Turn Order** through **Relevant Players. ** 

551.1.a.1. 

Players that control other **Triggered Abilities** that may have activated as a result of this **Chain** being constructed will become **Relevant** and order their **Triggered Abilities** on the **Chain** as **Turn Order** for **Focus** comes to them. 

551.1.b. 

If there are no such **Triggered Abilities** present during a **Combat**-initiated **Showdown** then no **Initial Chain** is created, but the **Showdown** will still proceed. 

552. 

When the last item on the chain resolves during a **Showdown**, **Focus** passes, and the next **Relevant** **Player** gains both **Focus** and **Priority. ** 

553. 

During a **Showdown**, the player with **Focus** may do one of the following: 553.1. 

**Play** a spell that is **legally timed. ** 

553.1.a. 

The spell will start a **Chain** as normal. 

553.1.a.1. 

This can cause players to become **Relevant**, and thus play **Spells** and activate **Abilities** during the rest of the **Showdown. ** 

553.2. 

**Activate** **Abilities** of **Game Objects** that are **legally timed. **

See **rule 564. Abilities** for more information. ** **

553.3. 

Invite a player to act. 

553.3.a. 

The invited player will gain **Focus. **

553.4. 

Pass. 

553.4.a. 

If all **Relevant Players** have passed once in sequence, the **Showdown** ends. 

553.4.a.1. 

Perform a **Cleanup. ** 

553.5 

Otherwise, **Focus** passes to the next **Relevant Player** in **Turn Order. ** 

**554. **

## **Playing Cards **

555. 

Playing a card is the act of a player utilizing their cards. 

555.1. 

A card is **Played** when it has finished this process in its entirety. 



555.2. 

Tokens are not cards, but can still be **Played. **

See **rule 170. Tokens** for more information. ** **

556. 

Cards have different behaviors when played. 

556.1. 

**Permanents** become **Game Objects** when **Played. ** 

556.2. 

**Spells** create game effects that are executed, then the card is placed in the trash when **Played. ** 

557. 

The Process of Play 

558. 

Remove the card from the zone you are playing it from and put it onto the **Chain. ** 

558.1. 

This **Closes the State. **

See **rule 507. States of the Turn** for more information. 

559. 

Make necessary choices. 

559.1. 

If the card is a spell, or has an effect that specifies a choice "As I am played," those choices are made now. 

559.2. 

For **Units**, choose a **Location** the player **Controls** on the **Board** where that **Unit** will be placed upon being **Played. ** 

559.3. 

If a card requires you to specifically choose one or more **Game Objects**, that choice is made now. 

559.3.a. 

This does not include cards that affect one or more **Game Objects** based on criteria. 

Example: "Stun a unit at a battlefield" is a **Choice. **

Example: "Kill all gear" is not a **Choice. **

559.3.b. 

This does not include making choices for **Triggered Abilities** of permanents, even if those abilities trigger when the permanent is played. 

Example: A unit with a triggered ability that says "When I'm played, kill a unit" does not require you to choose a target as it's played. The target will be chosen when the ability triggers. 



See **rule 582. Triggered Abilities** for more information. 

559.3.c. 

## **Targeting**

559.3.c.1. 

When a card **Chooses** one or more specific **Game Objects** to affect, it is **Targeted. ** 

559.3.c.2. 

If **all** of an instruction's **Targets** become **Invalid** or **Unavailable** by the time the spell is finished being played, that instruction will not execute. 

559.3.c.3. 

If an instruction has more than one **Target** and fewer than **all** of the **Targets** become **Invalid** or **Unavailable** by the time the spell is finished being played, the instruction will execute, with only the **Targets** available and valid being operated on. 

559.3.c.4. 

The process for a card's choice **becoming** **Invalid** or **Unavailable** is referred to as **mistargeting. **

Example: A spell has the instruction "Deal 2 to a unit at a battlefield." 

Before that instruction can execute, the chosen unit is moved to its 



base. The instruction will not be executed, because it specifies that the unit it chooses must be at a Battlefield, and by the time it attempted to execute, the unit was no longer valid as a choice. ** **

559.3.c.5. 

It is possible for **none** of a spell's instructions to be executed as it resolves, due to all of them requiring targets to act on and **all** of those targets becoming **Invalid** or **Unavailable**. In this case, the spell has no effect but is still considered played. 

Example: A player plays a spell that reads "Deal 2 to a unit at a battlefield" with no other instructions, and chooses an enemy unit at a battlefield. They also control a unit with the ability "When you play a spell, give me \+1 \[S\] this turn." Before the spell resolves, the chosen unit is moved to its base. The spell resolves and its only instruction cannot be executed, but the unit's ability still triggers as the spell resolves and gives it \+1 \[S\]. 

559.3.c.6. 

If a card specifies that a player may choose some number of **Game Objects** to be affected by a card, then all choices are considered targeted and chosen independently. 

559.3.d. 

## **Splitting**

559.3.d.1. 

If a card specifies that an amount of damage may be split among some number of **Units**, then each **Unit** chosen is **Targeted. ** 

559.3.d.2. 

The **Targets** are chosen when the spell is **Played** or the ability is added to the chain. 

559.3.d.3. 

A number of **Targets** can only be chosen up to, and not exceeding, the initial amount of damage available when the spell is played. 

Example: A player playing a spell that instructs them to "Split 5 

damage" may only choose up to 5 units, but may choose fewer. 

559.3.d.4. 

Each **Target** is valid, and contributes to **Chosen** triggers individually. 

559.3.d.5. 

The choice of how much damage is divided across the split is not decided until the resolution of the spell or ability. 

559.3.d.6. 

Each **Target** must receive a valid amount of damage. 

559.3.d.7. 

Valid damage is a positive integer amount, greater than or equal to 1 

damage. 

559.3.d.8. 

If, at resolution of the spell or effect, there are more **Targets** than available damage to divide, then the player who controls the effect dealing damage determines which **Targets** cease being **Targets. ** 

559.3.d.9. 

Any costs that were paid, or effects that were triggered as a result of those **Game Objects** being chosen as **Targets** remain in effect, paid, or otherwise triggered. 

559.4. 

These choices cannot be changed after this step. 

559.5. 

A player may not make choices during this step that will deterministically result in illegal choices or actions later in this process unless they have no choice. 

Example: A player plays Cruel Patron, which says "As an additional cost to play me, kill a friendly unit." They control exactly one unit, which is at a battlefield. They can't 



choose to play Cruel Patron to that battlefield, because by the time they have finished paying costs, they will no longer control that battlefield. 

560. 

Determine Total Cost. 

560.1. 

If an ability or instruction allows you to "ignore" one or more of a card's costs, set the appropriate **Base Cost\(s\)** of the card to zero. 

560.1.a. 

If a card allows a player to play a card "ignoring its cost," its base **Energy cost** and base **Power cost** are set to zero. 

560.1.b. 

If a card instructs a player to play a card "ignoring its Energy cost" or "ignoring its Power cost," only the appropriate cost is set to zero, and the remaining cost still applies. 

560.1.c. 

Further additional costs and/or cost increases applied in subsequent steps may raise the card's **Total Cost** above zero. 

Example: Legion Rearguard is a Fury unit that costs 2 Energy and 0 Power and has Accelerate. A player plays Legion Rearguard and is instructed to ignore its costs, but chooses to pay the Accelerate cost of \[1\]\[C\]. They ignore Legion Rearguard's **Base Cost** of 2 Energy, but the optional additional cost of 1 Energy and 1 Fury Power is added to its **Total Cost** and must be paid. 

560.2. 

Apply additional costs in any order. 

560.2.a. 

## **Mandatory Additional Costs**

560.2.a.1. 

Some **Additional Costs** specified by **Passive Abilities** on the card being played or another card are **Mandatory**, and must be paid to complete playing the card. They use the phrase "as an additional cost" and don't include the word "may." 

Example: A unit has the passive ability "As an additional cost to play me, kill a friendly unit." To play that unit, a player must kill a friendly unit. 



See **rule 567. Passive Abilities** for more information. 

560.2.a.2. 

The cost imposed by the **Deflect** keyword is a **Mandatory** **Additional Cost. **

See **rule 721. Deflect** for more information. ** **

560.2.b. 

## **Optional Additional Costs**

560.2.b.1. 

Some **Optional Costs** specified by **Passive Abilities** on the card being played or another card are **Non-Mandatory**, and must be paid only if the player made the choice to pay them in **rule 559. ** They use the phrase "as an additional cost" and the word "may." 

Example: A unit has the ability "As you play me, you may discard 1 

as an additional cost. If you do, reduce my cost by \[2\]." While playing the unit, its controller declares their intention to pay the additional cost in **rule 559**, applies that additional cost in **rule 560.2**, applies the discount granted by paying that cost in **rule 560.4**, and discards a card to pay that additional cost in **rule 561. **



See **rule 567. Passive Abilities** for more information. 

560.3. 

Apply cost increases. 



560.4. 

Apply discounts in any order. 

560.4.a. 

Discounts may be applied by the card being played or by any other card or effect. 

560.4.b. 

Discounts may say that cards "cost \[amount\] less" or that one or more of their costs are "reduced by \[amount\]." 

560.4.c. 

If a discount applies a minimum cost, that minimum applies only to that discount. 

Example: Eager Apprentice says "While I'm at a battlefield, the Energy costs for spells you play is reduced by \[1\], to a minimum of \[1\]." A player who controls Eager Apprentice and a unit with 7 Might plays Sky Splitter, a spell that costs 8 Energy and says "This spell's Energy cost is reduced by the highest Might among units you control." That player can choose to apply Eager Apprentice's discount first, reducing Sky Splitter's Energy cost to 7, then apply Sky Splitter's discount, reducing its Energy cost to 0. If they applied these discounts in the other order, Sky Splitter's Energy cost would be 1. 

560.4.d. 

Discounts can reduce additional costs, including to 0. 

560.4.d.1. 

An optional additional cost was "paid" if the player made the decision in **rule** **559** to pay it. It doesn't matter how much the player actually paid. 

Example: Clockwork Keeper is a unit that costs 2 Energy and 0 

Power and says "As you play me, you may pay \[C\] as an additional cost. If you do, draw " A player controls a card that says "Units you play cost \[A\] less." That player plays Clockwork Keeper and chooses to pay the optional additional cost of \[C\]. They will draw a card, even though the optional additional cost was reduced to 0. 

560.5. 

Energy and Power costs can't be reduced below 0. 

560.6. 

**Costs** may be Energy costs, Power costs, or non-standard costs. 

Example: A card reads "As an additional cost to play me, kill a friendly unit." Killing a friendly unit is an additional cost to play that card. 

561. 

Pay the card's costs. 

561.1. 

In total, pay the combined **Energy** cost \(if any\) and **Power** cost \(if any\). 

561.1.a. 

During this step, the spell's controller can use activated abilities with the **Reaction** tag that **Add** resources to add **Energy** and **Power** to pay the spell's costs. 

See **rule 158. Rune Pools** and **rule 605. Add** for more information. 

561.2. 

In addition, pay any non-standard **Cost** summed in **rule 560.2** in any order. 

561.3. 

A player may not pay costs during this step that will deterministically result in illegal choices or actions later in this process unless they have no choice. 

Example: A player plays Cruel Patron, which says "As an additional cost to play me, kill a friendly unit." They control multiple units, one of which is alone at a battlefield. 

During step b, they chose to play Cruel Patron to that battlefield. While paying costs, they can't choose to kill the unit at that battlefield, because then they will no longer control that battlefield and Cruel Patron cannot legally be played there. If they controlled that battlefield with multiple units, any of those units would be a legal choice, because they would still control the battlefield after killing one. 

562. 

Check legality. 



562.1. 

Check that all chosen targets are legal. 

562.2. 

Ensure that the outcome of the effect of this card being played would not create an illegal state. 

Example: Check that a spell's execution does not create a state where a Battlefield has **Units** controlled by 3 different players. 

562.3. 

If the card, if continued to be played, would create an illegal state, or if a choice or action at this state is illegal, the actions taken in this process are undone and the action is cancelled. 

563. 

Proceed with the card's category of **Play. ** 

563.1. 

A **Permanent** leaves the **Chain** and becomes a **Game Object. ** 

563.1.a. 

Any static rules text becomes active. 

563.1.b. 

Execute all rules text on the card, from top to bottom. 

563.1.c. 

If it is a **Unit**, it enters **the Board** **exhausted** at the **Location** that was chosen. 

563.1.d. 

If it is a **Gear, ** it enters **the Board** **Ready** at the player's **Base. ** 

563.2. 

A **Spell** lingers on the **Chain. ** 

563.2.a. 

Other players have an opportunity to play **Reactions** before the resolution of spells. 

See **rule 532. Chains **for more information. 

563.2.b. 

Otherwise, execute the game effect of the spell, from top to bottom of the rules text of the card and then place the card in the **Trash** of the owning player. 

563.2.c. 

Handling illegal and impossible instructions 

563.2.c.1. 

The spell resolves even if some or all of its targets are illegal. 

563.2.c.2. 

A target is illegal as the spell resolves if it no longer meets the targeting requirements of the spell, or if it has changed **Zones** to or from a **Non-Board** **Zone. ** 

563.2.c.3. 

If a target ceases to meet the targeting requirements while the spell is on the chain, then meets them again, it's a legal target. 

Example: A spell targets "a unit at a battlefield." A player reacts with a spell that moves the unit to base, then another player reacts with a spell that moves it back to that battlefield, then the original spell resolves. The unit is a legal target. 

563.2.c.4. 

If a target changes **Zones** to or from a **Non-Board Zone** and then returns to its original zone, it is no longer a legal target, because it's not treated as the same object. 

Examples: 

An enemy unit at a battlefield is no longer a legal target if it is no longer an enemy, no longer a unit, or no longer at a battlefield. 



A unit with 3 or less Might is no longer a legal target if it is no longer a unit or if its Might is greater than 3. 



Something that's exhausted is no longer a legal target if it is no longer exhausted. \(It can't stop being "something."\) 





A spell that's played from hidden has the additional targeting requirement "here." A target for such a spell ceases to be a legal target if it moves from the battlefield where that spell was played, even if the spell has no location targeting requirement otherwise. 

563.2.c.5. 

If any of the spell's targets are no longer legal, those targets are unaffected by the spell as it resolves. 

Example: A player plays Void Seeker, a spell that says "Deal 4 to a unit at a battlefield. Draw " The unit's controller uses a Reaction to move the unit to their base. Since the unit is no longer a legal target, it is not dealt any damage. Void Seeker's controller still draws 1. 

563.2.c.6. 

Instructions that can't be followed, either because of illegal targets or other circumstances, are ignored. 

563.2.c.7. 

Instructions that can be partially followed are followed as much as possible and ignored otherwise. 

Example: A player plays a spell that says "Discard 2, then draw 2" If their hand is empty, the instruction to discard 2 will be ignored. 

They'll still draw 2. If they had 1 card in hand, they would discard it and draw 2. 

563.2.c.8. 

If the spell checks information about a target that is no longer legal or a card or permanent whose location, zone, or status has changed such that that information is no longer available, that check returns "zero" or "null" as appropriate. 

Example: A unit that is no longer on the board is treated as having 0 

Might, 0 cost, etc. 



Example: A unit that is no longer on the board has no location, is neither exhausted nor readied, etc. 



Example: Last Breath says "Ready a friendly unit. It deals damage equal to its Might to an enemy unit at a battlefield." While Last Breath is on the chain, an opponent reacts with a spell that returns the friendly unit to its owner's hand. Because the friendly unit is no longer a legal target, it can't be readied and its Might is treated as 0. 

Last Breath readies nothing and deals 0 damage to the chosen enemy unit. 

563.2.c.9. 

A spell or ability that moves something to a different zone as a cost or effect can "look back" at its characteristics before it changes zones. 

**564. **

## **Abilities **

565. 

An **Ability** is the structured rules and capabilities of **Game Objects** or **Spells. ** 

565.1. 

An **Ability** has multiple structures. 

**Passive** **Abilities **

**Replacement Effects **

**Activated Abilities **

## **Triggered Abilities **

566. 

A card can have more than one **Ability** and more than one type of **Ability. ** 



567. 

Passive Abilities 

568. 

Conditions, rules, constraints, or statements that affect the course of regular play. 

568.1. 

These abilities have a wide variety of formats to recognize. 

Example: "I get \+1\[S\] while you have 2 or more cards in your hand." 



Example: "Friendly Yordles at my battlefield have \[Shield\]." 

568.2. 

They can be recognized by being **statements of fact. ** 

568.3. 

**Passive Abilities** can be conditional. 

568.3.a. 

**Conditional** **Passive Abilities** can be recognized by the occurrence of "if" or "while" 

as part of the statement of the ability. 

Example: " **While** I'm attacking or defending alone, I have \+2 \[S\]." 



Example: " **If** an opponent controls a battlefield, I enter ready." 

569. 

Presence on **Permanents** 

569.1. 

Passive Abilities of **Permanents** are typically only active while on **the Board. ** 

570. 

Presence on **Card outside of the Board** 

570.1. 

**Passive Abilities** of cards in zones that are outside of **the Board** will self-describe their context. 

Example: The passive ability "Play me only during an opponent's turn." applies in any zone from which that card can be played. 

570.2. 

**Passive Abilities** can alter the costs of cards as they are played. 

570.2.a. 

These apply at all times in any zone from which the card with the ability can be played. 

571. 

Replacement Effects 

572. 

An ability that alters the application of another game effect or game rule. 

572.1. 

**Passive Abilities** can be **Replacement Effects. ** 

572.2. 

**Triggered Abilities** can be **Replacement Effects. ** 

573. 

**Replacement Effects** intercede during the execution of a Game Effect and alter its execution. 

573.1. 

A **Replacement Effect** can be identified by the presence of the term "instead." 

Example: Zhonya's Hourglass reads "The next time a friendly unit would die, kill this instead. Recall that unit exhausted." This is a replacement effect that alters the execution of any Game Effect that would kill a friendly unit. 

574. 

A **Replacement Effect** can alter the typical flow of play, including other cards' executions. 

575. 

If more than one **Replacement Effect** applies to the same event being executed, then the owner of the object being acted on determines the order the **Replacement Effects** will apply. 

575.1. 

If it is a player being acted on, that player decides the order the **Replacement Effects** will apply. 



575.2. 

If the affected object is an **Uncontrolled Battlefield** then the **Current Turn Player** decides the order the **Replacement Effects** will apply. 

576. 

Activated Abilities 

577. 

**Activated Abilities** are repeatable effects with a cost. They follow a process of going onto the chain and resolving, similar to **Playing a Card. **

See **rule 554. Playing Cards** for more information. ** **

577.2. 

**Activated Abilities** are recognized by the presence of a ":" in the text of the card, preceded by a cost and succeeded by an effect. 

Example: "\[2\]: Draw 1" is an activated ability. The **cost** is 2 energy. The **effect** is to draw 1 card. 

577.3. 

**Activated Abilities** use the chain. 

577.3.a. 

Declare activation of the **Ability. ** 

577.3.a.1. 

The ability goes on the chain but has no card to represent it, so players need to take note that it is now a **Closed State. ** 

577.3.b. 

Follow the steps laid out in **rules 557 through 563**, replacing all instances of "play" 

with "activate" and "card" with "ability." 

577.3.c. 

Proceed with executing the **Chain. ** 

577.3.c.1. 

Opponents have an opportunity to respond, as appropriate, as if a card was played onto the chain. 

577.3.c.2. 

If no further action is taken, execute the **Activated Ability. ** 

578. 

The controlling player chooses when and whether to activate an **Activated Ability. ** 

579. 

Activated abilities are present on **Game Objects** and some **Spells. ** 

580. 

Can primarily be activated while on **the Board. ** 

581. 

All **Activated Abilities** can only be activated on the Control ing Player's Turn and during an **Open** **State. ** 

582. 

Triggered Abilities 

583. 

**Triggered Abilities** are repeatable effects that happen when a **Condition** is met. 

583.1. 

**Triggered Abilities** can be recognized by the word "when" or "at" in the **Ability. **

Example: " **When** you conquer here, you may spend a buff to draw " 



Example: "At the end of your turn, ready 2 runes." 

583.2. 

**Triggered Abilities** have a **Condition** and an **Effect. ** 

583.2.a. 

The **Condition** follows the **When. ** 

583.2.b. 

The **Effect** is the **Instruction** that follows the comma after the **Condition. ** 

583.3. 

When a **Condition** is met, a **Triggered Ability** behaves like an **Activated Ability** and is placed on the **Chain. ** 



583.3.a. 

**Triggered Abilities** can be put on the **Chain** during **Closed States** or **Open States** on any player's turn. 

583.3.b. 

If more than one **Triggered Ability** is **Triggered** simultaneously, then the player that controls the **Abilities** selects the order to place them on the **Chain. ** 

583.3.b.1. 

If multiple players separately control **Triggered Abilities** that are **Triggered** simultaneously, then starting with the **Turn Player** and proceeding in **Turn** **Order**, each player orders their **Triggered Abilities** on the **Chain. ** 

584. 

Presence on **Permanents** 

584.1. 

Typically active while on **the Board. ** 

584.2. 

**Triggered Abilities** of **Permanents** are only able to have their **Conditions** evaluated while on **the Board. ** 

585. 

Presence on **Cards outside of the Board** 

585.1. 

**Triggered Abilities** on cards outside of **the Board** rely on the **Information Level** of the zone they are in. 

585.2. 

**Triggered Abilities** outside of **the Board** will self-describe their context. 

Example: The triggered ability "When you conquer, you may discard 1 to return this from your trash to your hand." triggers while the card it's on is in the trash, and not anywhere else. 

**586. **

## **Game Actions **

587. 

**Game Actions** are actions players may perform at any given time during the game. 

588. 

A player, unless otherwise specified or prompted, may only perform actions on their turn. 

589. 

There are two types of **Game Actions:** 

589.1. 

## **Discretionary Actions**

589.1.a. 

A **Discretionary Action** is a **Game Action** that may be performed **at any time** during a player's turn **during a Neutral Open State. **

See **rule 507. States of the Turn** for more information. ** **

589.1.b. 

A player may take any number of **Discretionary Actions** available to them during their turn. 

589.1.b.1. 

As long as any conditions, if applicable, are met. 

589.1.b.2. 

As long as any costs, if applicable, are paid. 

589.1.b.3. 

As long as it does not result in any forbidden action being taken or game state being created. 

Example: A player can't use the Standard Move discretionary action to move a unit to a **Battlefield** that's already occupied by **Units** controlled by two other players. 

589.2. 

## **Limited Actions**



589.2.a. 

A **Limited Action** is a game action that a spell, ability, or circumstance of the turn's progression causes the player to perform. A player cannot perform these actions at-will. 

589.2.b. 

These actions can only be taken when a player is instructed to do so as the execution of an effect or during their specified occasion during the turn. 

Example: A player may **Draw** during the **Draw Step** of the **Beginning Phase** of their turn or when instructed to do so by a spel or ability. They can't choose to **Draw** at any other time. 

590. 

Types of Actions 

591. 

## **Draw**

591.1. 

**Drawing** a card takes a single card from the top of the **Main Deck** and adds it to the player's **Hand. ** 

591.2. 

This is a **Limited Action. ** 

591.2.a. 

Each player draws 1 during the **Draw Step** of their **Beginning Phase. ** 

591.2.b. 

The player may draw cards when instructed to do so by other game effects. 

591.3. 

This action, when instructed, is formatted as "Draw X." 

591.4. 

If a player attempts to draw more cards than are available in their **Main Deck**, they do the following: 

591.4.a. 

Draw as many as possible. 

591.4.b. 

Perform a** Burn Out. **

See **rule 607. Burn Out **for more information. ** **

591.4.c. 

Draw the remaining cards needed to complete the **Draw** action. 

592. 

## **Exhaust**

592.1. 

**Exhausting** is an action that marks a non-spell **Game Object** as "spent." 

592.1.a. 

To mark it, rotate the card 90 degrees opposite of **Readying**, so that the orientation of the card is lengthwise in front of you. 

592.1.b. 

A **Unit** that is already **Exhausted** cannot be **Exhausted** again. 

592.1.c. 

If a **Unit** is instructed to be **Exhausted** while it is already **Exhausted**, nothing additional happens. 

592.2. 

**"Exhausted" ** is a state for **Game Objects** that other game effects and rules can reference. 

592.3. 

This is a **Limited Action. ** 

592.3.a. 

Most **Exhaust** actions will be costs for Activated Abilities or **Discretionary Actions. **

Example: A unit's Standard Move exhausts the unit as a cost. ** **

592.4. 

When **Exhausting** is listed as a **Cost**, then the Action must be able to be completed for the cost to be paid. 



Example: A spell says "As an additional cost to play this, you may exhaust a friendly unit." An exhausted friendly unit may not be exhausted again as the additional cost for the spell, and the additional cost has not been paid. 

592.5. 

In abilities, the **Exhaust symbol** represents the cost "Exhaust this" or "Exhaust me." It resembles a card turning sideways. 

593. 

## **Ready**

593.1. 

**Readying** is an action that marks a non-spell **Game Object** as available for action. 

593.2. 

To mark it, rotate the card 90 degrees opposite of **Exhausting**, so that it is vertically oriented in front of you. 

593.3. 

**"Ready" ** is a state for **Game Objects** that other game effects and rules can reference. 

593.4. 

This is a **Limited Action. ** 

593.4.a. 

A player **Readies** all non-spell **Game Objects** they **Control** during the **Ready Step** of the **Beginning Phase** on their turn. 

593.4.b. 

The player may also **Ready** their **Game Objects** when effects or spells instruct them to do so. 

594. ## **Recycle**

594.1. **Recycling** cards is the action in which a player takes one or more cards from a specific zone and then puts it on the bottom of the corresponding deck. 
594.1.a. **Main Deck** cards are **Recycled** to the **Main Deck. ** 
594.1.b. **Runes** are **Recycled** to the **Rune Deck. ** 

594.2. This is a **Limited Action. ** 
594.2.a. The player must **Recycle** cards from the specified zones when instructed to do so by game effects or costs. 

594.3. When **Recycling** is listed as a **Cost**, the action must be able to be completed for the cost to be paid. 
Example: Vi, Destructive has the ability "Recycle 1 from your trash: Give me \+1 \[S\] this turn." Each time a player activates the ability, they must recycle 1 card from their trash to pay its cost. If they have no cards in their trash, they can't activate the ability, because they can't pay its cost. 

594.4. When **Recycling** is part of an effect, a player must **Recycle** as many cards as possible from the specified zone or zones. 

594.5. If 2 or more cards are **Recycled** to the **Main Deck** simultaneously, they are placed on the bottom of that deck in a random order. 
Example: Garbage Grabber has the ability "Recycle 3 from your trash, \[1\], \[T\]: Draw " To pay the cost of activating this ability, its controller chooses 3 cards from their trash and places them on the bottom of their **Main Deck** in a random order. 
594.5.a. If 2 or more cards are **Recycled** to the **Rune Deck** simultaneously, they are placed on the bottom of that deck in the order of their owner's choosing. 

594.6. This action, when instructed, is sometimes formatted as " **Recycle** X from \[Zone\]." That means to take X cards of the instructed player's choice from the relevant zone and recycle them. 
Example: Dr. Mundo, Expert has the ability "At the start of your Beginning Phase, recycle 3 from your trash." As that ability resolves, its controller recycles 3 cards from their trash. If there are fewer than 3 cards in that player's trash, they recycle as many as they can. 

595. 

## **Play**

595.1. 

A player **Plays** cards by paying costs associated with that card. 

See **rule 554. Playing Cards** for more information. 

595.2. 

This is a **Discretionary Action. ** 

595.2.a. 

As long as a player has the resources to pay the costs associated with the card, they may **play** cards. 

595.3. 

Game effects may result in cards being **played** as part of their resolution. 

595.3.a. 

This treats **Play** as a **Limited Action. ** 

595.3.b. 

Treat all steps of **Play** as normal, except as noted by the game effect creating this **Limited Play Effect. ** 

595.3.c. 

If there are no eligible cards to **Play** when instructed to **Play** in this manner like this, then nothing happens and resolution continues. 

595.4. 

Some **Abilities** trigger when cards are played or otherwise check whether cards have been played. 

595.4.a. 

These abilities trigger when the act of playing the card has been completed by the resolution of the card. 

595.4.b. 

If a game effect prevents the resolution of the card—for example, because the card was **countered**—the card wasn't played and no abilities that trigger on playing cards trigger. 

See **rule 601. Counter** for more information. 

596. 

## **Move**

596.1. 

**Moving** is the act of a **Game Object** moving between two **Locations** on **The Board. ** 

596.2. 

**Moving** is a **Limited Action. ** 

596.2.a. 

Players may only move **Game Objects** when instructed to do so by Game Effects or costs. 

596.2.b. 

The **Standard Move** inherent to **Units** may also cause **Movement. **

See **rule 140 **for more information on the **Standard Move**. ** **

596.3. 

The **Standard Move** inherent to **Units** is a **Discretionary Action. ** 

596.3.a. 

The **Cost** is **Exhausting** one or more **Units. ** 

596.3.b. 

The **Effect** is **Moving** those **Unit. ** 

597. 

## **Hide**



597.1. 

**Hiding** a card is the act of placing a card facedown at a **Battlefield** you control. 

597.2. 

**Hiding** is a **Discretionary Action. ** 

597.2.a. 

The **Hidden** keyword allows a player to pay a cost to **Hide** a card any time they have a **Hidden** card in their hand and meet the prerequisites. 

See **rule 723. Hidden **for more information. 

597.3. 

Cards that are facedown at **Battlefields** have their gameplay properties and permissions defined by the effect that put them there. 

Example: Cards that players **Hide** with the **Hidden** keyword can be **Played** for \[0\] on any subsequent turn as a property of the **Hidden** keyword. 

597.4. 

If a facedown card would be put into a zone whose **Privacy** is **Private** or **Secret**, or if the game ends, its owner reveals it to all players. 

See **rule 127. Privacy** for more information. 

598. 

## **Discard**

598.1. 

**Discarding** a card is moving it from a player's hand directly into their trash without activating or executing its normal rules text. 

598.1.a. 

The player who is performing the action chooses which cards to send to their **Trash**, and may use **Private Information** to do so. 

598.1.b. 

When I am discarded abilities or other **Triggered Abilities** that trigger on discarding are executed after discarding has occurred. 

598.2. 

**Discarding** is a **Limited Action. ** 

598.2.a. 

A player must **Discard** cards when instructed to do so by game effects or costs. 

598.3. 

When **Discarding** is listed as a **Cost**, then the Action must be able to be completed for the cost to be paid. 

Example: A card has the ability "Discard 2: Deal 2 damage to a unit at a battlefield." 

To activate the ability, the card's controller must have at least 2 cards in hand and must be able to discard them. 

598.4. 

When **Discarding** is part of an effect, then a player must **Discard** as many cards as possible from their hand. If instructed to discard more cards than they have in their hand, further discard instructions are ignored. 

Example: Undercover Agent has the ability "\[Deathknell\] — Discard 2, then draw 2. 

\(When I die, get the effect.\)" If Undercover Agent's controller has 2 or more cards in hand, they must discard 2. If they have 1 card in hand, they discard 1, and the rest of the discard instruction is ignored. If they have no cards in hand, the entire discard instruction is ignored. Regardless of how many cards they discard, they then draw 2. 

598.5. 

This action is formatted as "Discard X." 

599. 

## **Stun**

599.1. 

**Stunning** is the act of selecting one or more **Units** on **the Board** and rendering them **Stunned. ** 

599.1.a. 

**Stunned** is a binary state. A **Unit** is **Stunned** or it isn't. 

599.1.a.1. 

A **Stunned Unit** can not be **Stunned** again. 



Example: Eclipse Herald has the ability "When you stun an enemy unit, ready me and give me \+1 \[S\] this turn." Its controller plays a spell that reads "Stun a unit." They may choose a unit that's already stunned, but if they do, Eclipse Herald will not trigger. 

599.1.a.2. 

**Stunned** **Units** lose the **Stunned** status at the beginning of the next **Ending** **Step. ** 

599.1.b. 

A **Stunned** **Unit** does not contribute its might to damage in combat. 

599.1.c. 

A **Stunned** **Unit** must still have damage applied to it equal to, or greater than, its full might value to be killed. 

599.2. 

**Stunning** is a **Limited Action. ** 

599.2.a. 

Players may only **Stun** **Units** when directed to by **Game Effects. ** 

600. 

## **Reveal**

600.1. 

**Revealing** is the act of presenting a card to al players from a zone that one or more players do not have access to the information of. 

600.1.a. 

**Revealed** is a temporary state and is not a zone. 

600.1.a.1. 

Other cards, including the card being revealed, can reference the act of being **Revealed. ** 

600.1.a.2. 

Cards remain in the zone they are being **Revealed** from. 

Example: If a card is being **Revealed** from the top of a player's **Main** **Deck**, it is still the top card of that player's **Main Deck. ** 

600.1.b. 

Unless otherwise described, **Revealed** cards do nothing else beyond become temporarily known information to al players. 

600.2. 

**Revealing** is a **Limited Action. ** 

600.2.a. 

Players may only **Reveal** cards from **Private** or **Secret** zones when instructed to do so by **Game Effects. ** 

600.2.b. 

During the course of a game of **Riftbound**, a player may choose to show **Private** information to one or more other players. This does not count as revealing and does not trigger any effects that trigger when cards are revealed. 

600.3. 

This action is formatted as "Reveal cards from \[zone\]." 

Example: "Reveal 2 cards from the top of your Main Deck" would be executed by taking the two cards from the top of your Main Deck, and then presenting them to all players to clearly read and understand at the table. Then, when all players have had a chance to understand the revealed information, return them to the top of the deck in the same order. 

600.4. 

**Game Effects** can manipulate or modify the cards **Revealed** while they are **Revealed** 600.4.a. 

While cards are **Revealed**, those cards can be further manipulated, or accessed. They can even have their destination modified for when the **Reveal** ends. 

Example: "Reveal 2 cards from the top of your Main Deck. Put one into your hand and Recycle the other" would be executed by taking the top two cards from your Main Deck to the table, and once every player present has had a 



chance to understand them you would make the selection of one of them to add to your hand. The one you did not select would then be **Recycled** to the bottom of the **Main Deck. ** 

601. 

## **Counter**

601.1. 

**Countering** is the act of negating the execution, activation, or otherwise playing of a card by a player. 

601.1.a. 

A card that is **Countered** does nothing and is then placed in the **Trash. ** 

601.1.b. 

A card that is **Countered** is not considered to have been played. 

601.1.c. 

**Countering** does not refund any costs paid to play a card. 

601.1.c.1. 

This includes additional costs. 

601.2. 

Countering is a **Limited Action. ** 

601.2.a. 

Players may only **Counter** cards when directed to by **Game Effects. ** 

601.3. 

This action is formatted as " **Counter** \[a card or ability on the chain\]." 

602. 

## **Buff**

602.1. 

**Buffing** is the action of placing a **Buff** counter on a **Unit**. 

See **rule 701. Buffs** for more information. 

602.1.a. 

A **Buff** is also an object. 

602.1.b. 

To **Buff** a unit, place a **Buff Counter** on it if it does not have one already 602.1.b.1. 

If the unit already has a **Buff Counter** on it, it does not get another one. 

602.1.c. 

Units with **Buff Counters** can still be chosen for actions that **Buff** units, but will not be **Buffed** as part of the execution. 

Example: A spell reads "Buff a unit. Then, if it was buffed this way, draw a card." It will place a buff counter on a unit that has no buff counter, and then its controller will draw a card. However, if the player chooses a unit with a buff counter on it already, then the card will not be drawn. 

602.2. 

**Buffing** is a **Limited Action. ** 

602.2.a. 

Players may only **Buff** units when **Game Effects** direct them to do so. 

602.3. 

This action is formatted as " **Buff** \[one or more units\]." 

Example: "Buff a unit." 



Example: "Buff a friendly unit." 



Example: "Buff two friendly units at the same battlefield." 

603. 

## **Banish**

603.1. 

**Banishing** is the action of placing a card from any zone to **Banishment. **

See **107.5. Banishment** for more information. ** **

603.2. 

When a card is **Banished** it is placed directly into the **Banishment** zone from its origin. 



603.2.a. 

Banish is not a subset of **Kill. ** 

603.2.b. 

Banish is not a subset of **Discard. ** 

603.3. 

Cards and effects can refer to cards that were banished by the same object. 

603.3.a. 

Separate instances of an object or effect banishing cards do not reference other banished cards by objects of the same name or effects originating from cards of the same name. 

Example: A spell reads "Banish the top card of your Main Deck. When you conquer this turn, draw it." 



This card effect allows you to draw the banished card from banishment if a condition is met. 



If more than one of these effects is played, each one triggers separately. 

Each card will be drawn separately. 



If the turn player passes the turn without playing the card, the card remains in banishment indefinitely. If the same player plays another copy of the same spell, banishes another card, and satisfies its condition, they could play the new banished card, but not the original banished card. 

603.4. 

**Banishing** is a **Limited Action. ** 

603.4.a. 

Players may only **Banish** cards or permanents when **Game Effects** direct them to do so. 

603.5. 

This action is formatted as "Banish \[one or more permanents or cards\]." 

Example: "Banish a card from your hand." 



Example: "Banish 2 cards from your trash." 



Example: "Look at the top 2 cards of your Main Deck. Draw one of them and banish the other." 

604. 

## **Kill**

604.1. 

**Killing** is the action of a **Permanent** going to the trash from the board. 

604.1.a. 

This can be **Active** or **Passive. ** 

604.1.a.1. 

**Active** **Kill** is when the action is taken when instructed by a game effect or as a cost for a card or ability. 

604.1.a.2. 

**Passive Kill** is when the action is taken as a result of **Lethal Damage** or as a consequence for any other state. 

604.2. 

When a **permanent** is **killed** it is placed directly in the trash from its place of origin. 

604.2.a. 

It is only considered **Killed** if its origin was any zone on the board. 

604.2.b. 

This is not a subset of **Move. ** 

604.3. 

**Killing** is a **Limited Action. ** 

604.3.a. 

Players may only **Kill** units when **Game Effects** direct them to do so. 



604.4. 

This action is formatted as "Kill \[one or more permanents\]." 

Example: "Kill an enemy unit." 



Example: "Kill this, \[2\]: Draw " 



Example: "Kill all gear." 

605. 

## **Add**

605.1. 

**Adding** is the action of putting resources into a player's **Rune Pool. ** 

605.2. 

Spells and activated abilities that **Add** resources resolve immediately. They can't be reacted to. 

605.3. 

Activated abilities that **Add** resources and have the **Reaction** tag can be activated during the playing or resolution of other spells and abilities, any time that those spells or abilities require that resources be paid. 

Example: A player can add Energy and Power through any means before initiating the process of playing a spell. After initiating that process, in the Pay Costs step, they may activate **Add Reactions** to add Energy or Power to pay costs. 

605.4. 

**Adding** is a **Limited Action. ** 

605.4.a. 

Players may only **Add** resources when **Game Effects** direct them to do so. 

605.5. 

This action is formatted as "Add \[one or more resources\]." 

Example: "Add \[2\]." means "Add 2 Energy." 



Example: "\[T\]: Add \[Y\]." means "Add 1 Power of the Order domain." 



Example: "Add \[1\]\[G\]." means "Add 1 Energy and 1 Power of the Calm domain." 

606. 

## **Channel**

606.1. 

**Channeling** is the action of taking one or more **Runes** from the top of a player's **Rune Deck** and putting them on the board. 

606.2. 

The **Game Effect** that instructs a player to channel 1 or more runes may specify the conditions or circumstances under which those runes enter the board. 

Example: A spell reads "Channel 1 rune exhausted." As that spell resolves, its controller puts the top rune of their rune deck onto the board and that rune enters the board exhausted rather than ready. 

606.3. 

**Channeling** is a **Limited Action. ** 

606.3.a. 

Players may only channel runes when **Game Effects** direct them to do so. 

606.4. 

This action is formatted as "Channel X rune\(s\)," optionally followed by conditions or stipulations. 

Example: "Channel 1 rune." 



Example: "When you play me, channel 1 rune exhausted." 



Example: "Channel 2 runes exhausted. If you couldn't channel 2 runes this way, draw 1." 

607. 

## **Burn Out**



607.1. 

**Burning Out** is an action a player must perform if they attempt to do any of the following while their **Main Deck** is empty: 

607.1.a. 

Draw 1 or more cards. 

607.1.b. 

Look at or reveal cards from their **Main Deck. ** 

607.1.c. 

Put 1 or more cards from their **Main Deck** into their trash. 

607.2. 

To **Burn Out**, a player does the following in sequence: 607.2.a. 

Shuffles their trash into their Main Deck. 

607.2.b. 

Chooses an opponent to gain 1 point. 

607.2.c. 

Performs the action that caused them to burn out. 

Example: A player attempts to draw 1 during their Draw Phase while their Main Deck is empty. That player instead shuffles their trash into their Main Deck, chooses an opponent to gain 1 point, and then draws 1. 

607.3. 

A player's Main Deck may remain empty as they **Burn Out**, usually because their trash is also empty. When they attempt to perform the original action again, it will cause another **Burn** **Out**. 

607.3.a. 

Unless some effect intervenes, this will result in them burning out repeatedly, giving 1 

point to an opponent each time, until an opponent passes the Victory Score and wins the game. 

607.4. 

**Burning Out** is a **Limited Action. ** 

607.4.a. 

Players may only burn out when **Game Effects** direct them to do so. 

607.5. 

**Burning Out** is a **Replacement Effect. **

See **rule 571. Replacement Effects** for more information. ** **

**608. **

## **Movement **

609. 

**Moving** is a **Limited Action. ** 

609.1. 

A **Permanent** changing its position from any space on **the Board** to another space on **the** **Board** is a **Move**, unless it is caused by a corrective **Recall**. 

See **rule 596. Move** for more information. 

609.2. 

A card changing game zones does not in itself constitute a **Move. ** 

609.3. 

**Moving** is instantaneous. 

609.3.a. 

There is no state for **Permanents** between locations. 

609.3.b. 

**Permanents** are either at their **Origin** before **Moving** or their **Destination** after **Moving. ** 

609.3.c. 

**Moving** does not use the **Chain**, nor is it able to be **Reacted** to. 

610. 

**Moving** is defined by the **Origin** and **Destination** of the **Permanent** that is changing locations. 

610.1. 

The **Origin** is where the **Permanent** is starting from. 



610.2. 

The **Destination** is where the **Permanent** is going to. 

610.2.a. 

In **Modes of Play** with more than two players, **Battlefields** with **Pending Combats** or **Combats in Progress** are **Invalid Destinations** for **Moves** of all kinds \(**Standard** **Moves** or otherwise\) by **Units** controlled by **Players** who don't already have permanents at that **Battlefield**. 

610.2.b. 

If an action would require a **Move** that would cause a **Unit** to become present in a **Battlefield** where two players that are **not** the controller of the **Unit** performing this action are in a **Combat** or such a **Combat** is **Pending**, it instead **Recalls. **

See **rule 616. Recalls** for more information. ** **

610.3. 

**Units** are the only **Permanents** that can **Move. ** 

611. 

Players may choose to move their **Units** with the **Standard Move. **

See **rule 140. ** for more information on the **Standard Move. **

612. 

**Spells**, **Abilities**, or other effects may cause a **Move** to occur. 

612.1. 

The source of the **Move** will provide details on any restrictions on legality for **Destination. ** 

612.2. 

**Units cannot Move** to a **Battlefield** that already has units from 2 other players present by any means. 

613. 

**Units** may cause a **Showdown** without a **Combat** when they **Move. ** 

613.1. 

A **Showdown** is opened when a **Move** causes a **Battlefield** to become **Contested** while it has no **Units** present from any player other than those that just moved. 

614. 

**Units** may cause **Combat** when they **Move. ** 

614.1. 

A **Combat** is triggered when a **Move** causes a **Battlefield** to become **Contested** and **Units** controlled by opposing players. 

See **rule 620. Combat** for more information. 

615. 

When a **Move** action is complete, perform a **Cleanup. ** 

616. 

Recalls 

617. 

A **Recall** is when a **Permanent** changes locations without it being a **Move. ** 

618. 

**Recalls** are not **Moves. ** 

618.1. 

They do not cause **Triggered Abilities** to trigger that are triggered by **Move** actions. 

618.2. 

A **Recall** causes a **Permanent** to change locations. 

618.3. 

A **Recall** cannot be prevented by actions and **Game Effects** that restrict or block **Movement. ** 

619. 

Gear can be **Recalled. ** 

619.1. 

When **Gear** is created or played at a battlefield, or is at a battlefield for any other reason, it is **Recalled** to its controller's base during the next **Cleanup. **

Example: Zhonya's Hourglass is a gear with the **Hidden** ability, which allows it to be hidden at a battlefield and played later to that battlefield. If Zhonya's Hourglass is played from hidden, it must be played to that battlefield. It will be recalled to its controller's base during the next **Cleanup. **



**620. **

## **Combat **

621. 

A **Combat** occurs when a **Cleanup** occurs, there are no items on the **Chain**, and a **Battlefield** has **Units** controlled by **two** opposing players. 

622. 

**Combat** is considered **Pending** if there are units controlled by two opposing players at a **Battlefield** but the **Steps of Combat** have not been initiated. 

622.1. 

If more than one **Battlefield** has **Units** controlled by opposing players at it at the same time, the **Turn Player** decides which **Combat** to resolve first. 

622.2. 

If **Pending Combats** stop being **Pending** before the **Steps of Combat** are initiated, they are not resolved or executed. 

623. 

**Combat** can only occur between **Units** controlled by exactly two players. 

623.1. 

In **Modes of Play** with more than two players, **Battlefields** with **Pending Combats** or **Combats in Progress** are **Invalid Destinations** for **Moves** of all kinds \(**Standard Moves** or otherwise\) by **Units** controlled by **Players** who don't already have permanents at that **Battlefield. **

See **rule 610.2.a. ** for more information on **Invalid Destinations. **

623.2. 

In **Modes of Play** with more than two players, **Battlefields** with **Pending Combats** or **Combats in Progress** are **Invalid** to be chosen as a location to play one or more **Units** by a player not involved in that **Combat** by any means 

623.2.a. 

If an effect would require a **Unit** be played to a **Battlefield** with a **Pending Combat** or a **Combat in Progress**, where the controller of the played unit is not a participant, instead the **Unit** is played to its controller's **Base. ** 

623.2.b. 

Any subsequent reference to "here" in the corresponding effect is reassigned to the Controller's **Base**, where the **Unit** was played. Any further effects that may be invalidated are invalidated as if the effect was mistargeted. 

See **rule 559.3.c. Targeting** for more information on **Mistargeting. **

623.3. 

All choices that would result in a **Combat** occurring between more than two players simultaneously are invalid and ineligible to be completed. 

**624. **

## **The Steps of Combat **

625. 

**The** **Showdown Step** 

625.1. 

A **Showdown** opens at this time. 

625.1.a. 

Establish who is **Attacker** and who is **Defender. ** 

625.1.a.1. 

The **Attacker** is the player who applied the **Contested** status to the **Battlefield. ** 

625.1.b. 

The **Defender** is the player who did not apply the **Contested** status to the **Battlefield. **Modulate **Unit Might** now based on static combat abilities. 

625.1.b.1. 

Attacking **Units** with **Assault** have their **Might** modulated by the value of **Assault** at this time. 

625.1.b.2. 

Defending **Units** with **Shield** have their **Might** modulated by the value of **Shield** at this time. 



625.1.c. 

The **Initial Chain** is created, if relevant, and then populated. 

625.1.c.1. 

If "When I attack" **Triggered Abilities** have triggered, then they are put on the **Initial Chain. ** 

625.1.c.2. 

If "When I defend" **Triggered Abilities** have triggered, then they are put on the **Initial Chain. **

625.1.d. 

The **State Closes** if an **Initial Chain** was created. 

625.1.d.1. 

Otherwise the **Showdown** continues, with the **State Open** as normal. 

625.1.e. 

The **Attacking Player** becomes the **Active Player** 

625.1.f. 

Players proceed with any play on the **Chain** as normal. 

626. 

## **The Combat Damage Step**

626.1. 

When the **Showdown** closes, **Attackers** and **Defenders** resolve **Combat Damage** at the **Battlefield** that was attacked, using their current **Might. ** 

626.1.a. 

**The Combat Damage Step** only occurs if both **Attacking** and **Defending** units remain at the location. 

626.1.a.1. 

If neither **Attacking** **Units** nor **Defending Units** remain at this stage, no **Combat** occurred. Continue to **step 4. ** 

626.1.b. 

Sum the **Might** of all **Attacking Units. ** 

626.1.c. 

Sum the **Might** of all **Defending Units. ** 

626.1.d. 

Starting with the **Attacker**, each player distributes an amount of damage equal to their summed **Might** among the other's **Units. ** 

626.1.d.1. 

**Units** with **Tank** must be assigned **Lethal Damage** before any other units. 

626.1.d.1.a. 

Reminder: **Lethal Damage** is nonzero damage equaling or exceeding the **Might** of a **Unit. ** 

626.1.d.2. 

**Units** must have lethal damage assigned to them in full before damage is assigned to a different **Unit. **

Example: If a player has 5 damage to distribute among four 3 Might units, they may not choose to assign 2 damage to one of the units and 1 damage to each of the remaining 3. They must assign at least 3 damage to one, and the remaining 2 to another. ** **

626.1.d.3. 

A player must obey all requirements and restrictions on damage assignment if able. 

Example: A player is assigning damage to the following units: a unit with **Tank** \("I must be assigned combat damage first."\); Caitlyn, Patrolling \("I must be assigned combat damage last."\); and another unit without any abilities. That player must assign combat damage first to the unit with Tank, then to the unit with no abilities, then to Caitlyn. 



626.1.d.4. 

If multiple **Units** have abilities or effects that require a player to assign them damage with the same priority, that player may assign damage to those units in any order. 

Example: A player is assigning damage to the following units: two units with **Tank** \("I must be assigned combat damage first."\) and one unit with no abilities. That player chooses one of the units with Tank and assigns combat damage to it. Then they must assign any remaining damage first to the other unit with Tank, then to the unit with no abilities. 

627. 

## **The Resolution Step**

627.1. 

Remove **Units** with **Lethal Damage** marked on them. 

627.1.a. 

Reminder: **Lethal Damage** is nonzero damage equaling or exceeding the **Might** of a **Unit. ** 

627.2. 

If both **Attacking** and **Defending** **Units** remain at the **Battlefield**, then **Attacking** **Units** are **recalled. **

See **rule 616. Recalls** for more information. ** **

627.3. 

The **Battlefield** is **Conquered** if **No Defending Units Remain** but **Attacking Units** do remain. 

627.3.a. 

This results in an exchange of **Control** of this battlefield, which subsequently will cause a **Conquer. **

See **rule 179. Control** for more information on **Control. **

See **rule 630.1** for more information on **Conquering. **

627.4. 

Clear the **Contested** status from this **Battlefield. ** 

627.5. 

Clear all marked damage from all **Units** at all **Locations. ** 

628. 

Perform a **Cleanup. ** 

**629. **

## **Scoring **

630. 

A player **Scores** in one of two ways: 

630.1. 

**Conquer:** A player gains **Control** of a **Battlefield** they did not yet **Score** this turn. 

630.1.a. 

In **Modes of Play** with teammates, **Battlefields** under the **Control** of a teammate during the **Beginning Phase** are also disqualified from being **Scored** through **Conquer** by any means. 

630.2. 

**Hold:** A player has **Control** of a **Battlefield** during their **Beginning Phase. ** 

631. 

A player may only **Score**, from either method, once per **Battlefield** per turn. 

632. 

When a player **Scores**, two things occur: 

632.1. 

The player earns up to one **Point**, depending on their current score. 

632.1.a. 

The **Final Point** has additional restrictions. 

632.1.a.1. 

Notably, points earned from sources that are not **Conquer** or **Hold** are not beholden to these restrictions. 



632.1.b. 

When a player tries to earn a **Point** through a **Score**, and their current **Point Total** is 1 point from the **Victory Score** of the **Mode of Play**, the following occurs: 632.1.b.1. 

If the player has **Scored** through **Hold**, that player scores the **Final** **Point. ** 

632.1.b.2. 

If the player has **Scored** through a **Conquer** and has **Scored** every **Battlefield** through either method this turn, that player scores the **Final** **Point. **If the player has **Scored** through a **Conquer** and has not **Scored** every **Battlefield** this turn, that player draws a card. 

632.2. 

Trigger **Score** **abilities** at the **Battlefield** that **Scored. ** 

632.2.a. 

**Conquer** **abilities** trigger at a **Battlefield** that was **Conquered. ** 

632.2.b. 

**Hold** **abilities** trigger at a **Battlefield** that was **Held. ** 

632.2.c. 

These will only trigger when the **Battlefield** is **Scored; ** I.E. These cannot be triggered more than once per turn for a player. 

633. 

When a player accrues **Points** equal to the **Victory Score** for their **Mode of Play**, they **Win the Game** immediately. 

**634. **

## **Layers **

635. 

Layers are the mechanism in which **Game Effects** alter the Traits, Intrinsic Abilities, or other properties of **Game Objects. ** 

636. 

Layers are an organizational structure. 

636.1. 

Layers do not have intrinsic rules or influence over the game. 

636.2. 

Layers only serve to structure the application and order that **Game Effects** apply to **Game** **Objects** to maintain consistency. 

637. 

The layers are: 

637.1. 

Trait-Altering Effects 

637.1.a. 

This layer deals with effects that grant, remove, or replace inherent traits of **Game** **Objects. **

Name 

Super Type 

Type 

Tags 

Controller 

Cost 

Domain** **

637.1.a.1. 

Assignment of Might is dealt with in this layer. 

Example: A spell reads "A unit's Might becomes 4 this turn." The unit's Might is set to 4 in this layer. 

637.1.b. 

One **Game Object** becoming a copy of another. 

637.1.b.1. 

All Traits, including the Rules Text, replace or are added to those of the original **Game Object** as specified by the **Game Effect** directing the Copy. 

This is applied in this layer. 



637.1.c. 

Effects for this layer can be identified by the phrase "become\(s\)", "give," "is," or "are" 

in the text. 

Example: A permanent has the ability "Other friendly units are Yordles." 

Other friendly units gain the Yordle tag in this layer. 

637.2. 

Ability-Altering Effects 

637.2.a. 

This layer deals with effects that grant, remove, or replace the abilities or rules text of **Game Objects**. 

Keywords 

Passive Abilities 

Appending rules text 

Removing rules text 

Duplicating Rules Text from one **Game Object** to another 637.2.b. 

Effects for this layer can be identified by the phrase "become\(s\)," "give," "lose\(s\)," 

"have," "has," "is," or "are" in the text. 

Example: A permanent has the ability "Other friendly units have \[Vision\]." 

Other friendly units gain the **Vision** keyword in this layer. 

637.3. 

Arithmetic 

637.3.a. 

This layer deals with the mathematics of increasing and decreasing the numeric values of the traits of **Game Objects. **

Might 

Energy Cost 

Power Cost 

637.3.b. 

All applications are applied arithmetically. 

638. 

If more than one effect applies to the same **Game Object** in the same **Layer**, or to each other in the same layer, then both effects will apply but their order will be determined by **Dependency. ** 

638.1. 

A **Dependency** is established if: 

638.1.a. 

Applying one of the effects alters the existence of the other; or 638.1.b. 

Applying one of the effects alters the number of objects the other effect can influence; or 

638.1.c. 

Applying one of the effects alters the outcome when applying the other 639. 

If more than one effect applies in the same layer but no dependency is established, then **Timestamp** order is applied to the effects 

639.1. 

The first effect to have been played is applied first, and the newest effect is applied last. 

**640. **

## **Modes of Play **

641. 

There are multiple methods of playing **Riftbound. ** 

642. 

A **Mode of Play** must define several variables for the game. 

642.1. 

**Number of Players**: How many people are playing the game. 

642.2. 

**Formation of Players**: How the players are organized while playing. 



642.2.a. 

This defines if a player is alone or on a team. 

642.2.b. 

This defines the number of opponents. 

642.3. 

**Victory Score:** The point total a player or team must reach to win. 

642.3.a. 

**Victory Scores** can be any positive number. 

642.4. 

**Battlefield Count:** Determines how many **Battlefields** are in play, contributed by players, during play. 

642.4.a. 

This may influence deck building requirements in competitive settings. 

642.4.b. 

This may involve utilizing less **Battlefields** than there are players. 

642.5. 

**Setup:** Any changes to initial setup required for this mode. 

642.6.

Players may play spells during their **Teammate's Turn. ** 

648.8.b. 

**Battlefields** controlled during the **Beginning Phase** of a player's turn by that player's teammate are **disqualified from being scored** by that Team, that turn.

Teammates are **Relevant Players** by default. 

648.8.f. 

Hands are still **Private Information. **

651.2. 

If more than one player remains after a concession, follow the steps for the **Removal of a** **Player. ** 

651.3. 

Removal of a player involves them no longer being a Relevant Player in any Showdown, being able to make choices, or otherwise influence the game. 

652. 

If the game continues, follow these steps for **Removal of a Player. ** 

652.1. 

**Banish** all permanents and runes they currently control and all permanents and runes they own. 

652.2. 

Remove the **Battlefield** they contributed to the game if it is in use. 



652.2.a. 

If it was in use, replace it with a token battlefield with no abilities. 

652.2.b. 

Any units or hidden cards there do not move and are otherwise unaffected by this process. 

652.2.c. 

If the removed battlefield was applying any continuous effects, those continuous effects immediately cease, which may cause changes in the characteristics of units or hidden cards there. 

Example: A battlefield reads "Units here have \+1 \[S\]." If that battlefield's owner concedes and the battlefield is removed from the game as a result, units there immediately cease to get \+1 \[S\]. 

652.3. 

Remove all cards they own from the game. 

652.4. 

**Counter** all spells and abilities of all types controlled by the player that has conceded.

Focus 

652.5.b.1. 

If the removed player had **Focus** in a **Showdown**, the next **Relevant Player** in order receives **Focus**. 

652.5.b.2. 

If no other players remain **Relevant**, the **Showdown** ends, and steps are completed as able 

652.5.b.3. 

If the player being removed creates a state where all **Relevant Players** have **Passed** their **Focus**, the **Showdown** ends and play proceeds as necessary, E.G. **Combat** is resolved or a **Cleanup** is completed. 

652.5.c. 

Priority 

652.5.c.1. 

If the removed player had **Priority** during a **Chain**, the next **Relevant Player** in order receives **Priority**. 

652.5.c.2. 

If the player being removed creates a state where all **Relevant Players** have passed **Priority**, then the most recent spell or ability on the **Chain** will resolve with **Priority** being re-established as appropriate for the state after the resolution of that spell or ability. 

700. Additional Rules 

**701. **

## **Buffs **

702. 

**Buffs** are objects placed on **Units. ** 

702.1. 

**Buffs** can be tracked with a buff reminder card from a **Riftbound** booster pack or with any spare object in your surroundings. 

702.2. 

**Buffs** can be added or spent. 



702.2.a. 

To **Buff** a **Unit**, a player chooses a **Unit** and then places a buff on it. That **Unit** is **Buffed** for as long as the buff remains on it. 

702.2.b. 

**Spending** a **Buff** removes a single **Buff** counter from a **Unit**. 

702.2.b.1. 

A buff cannot be spent from a **Unit** that does not have a buff. 

702.2.b.2. 

A player can only spend buffs on units they control. 

702.3. 

There can only be one **Buff** on a **Unit** at a time. 

702.3.a. 

If a **Buff** is added, or instructed to be added, on a **Unit** that already has a **Buff**, it is not placed instead. 

703. 

Each **Buff** individually contributes \+1 **Might** to a **Unit. ** 

704. 

**Buffs** are **Game Objects** and may be referenced, counted, or targeted by other effects as specified. 

705. 

If a **Unit** leaves play, remove all **Buffs** from it. 

705.1. 

**Champions** do not retain **Buffs** in the Champion Zone, even if they return there somehow. 

**706. **

## **Mighty **

707. 

**Mighty** is a description that applies to some units. Other game effects can check whether a unit is **Mighty. ** 

708. 

A **Unit** "is Mighty" as long as its Might is 5 or greater. 

709. 

A **Unit** "becomes Mighty" at the moment its Might changes from being less than 5 to being 5 or greater. 

Example: A Unit with Might 4 that gets \+1 \[S\] becomes **Mighty**. 



Example: A Unit with Might 5 that gets \+1 \[S\] does not become **Mighty**, because it was already **Mighty. ** 

710. 

Units on the board are evaluated according to their current Might. 

Example: A unit with a base Might of 3 is targeted by a spell that reads "A unit gets \+3 \[S\] this turn." As that spell resolves, its Might changes from 3 to 6, and it becomes **Mighty**. When that effect expires at the end of the turn, it will no longer be **Mighty. ** 

711. 

Units in **Non-Board Zones** are evaluated according to their inherent Might. 

Example: A unit in the trash is **Mighty** if its printed Might is 5 or greater. It doesn't matter if there were effects raising or lowering its might while it was on the board. 

**712. **

## **Keywords **

713. 

A **Keyword** is a specific term that appears on **Cards** that acts as a shorthand for a specific game effect, or **ability** of any variety. 

713.1. 

A **Keyword** can be an ability. 

713.2. 

**Keywords** can be identified by having a **colored highlight** behind them. 

713.2.a. 

The color of the highlight has no effect on gameplay. 

713.3. 

**Keywords** can be referenced or specified by other **Game Effects. ** 



713.3.a. 

Other effects may grant **Keywords. ** 

713.3.a.1. 

The definition and rules of the specific **Keyword** will determine the behavior if a **Keyword** is granted while it is already present. 

713.3.a.2. 

The effect that granted the **Keyword** will specify the duration for which it is granted. 

713.3.a.3. 

If an effect that grants a **Keyword** does not specify a duration, the duration is as long as that **Game Object** remains on **the Board** or in its current **Non-Board Zone. ** 

713.3.b. 

Other effects may remove **Keywords. ** 

713.3.b.1. 

The effect that removed the **Keyword** will specify the duration it is removed. 

713.3.b.2. 

If an effect that removes a **Keyword** does not specify a duration, the duration is as long as that **Game Object** remains on **the Board** or in its current **Non-Board Zone. ** 

714. 

A card can have any number of **Keywords. ** 

715. 

Similar to other rules text, execute any effects of **Keywords** in the order listed when reading the card from top to bottom of the rules text. 

716.

717.1.a. 

Accelerate is functionally short for "As you play me, you may pay 1\[C\] as an additional cost. If you do, I enter ready."

717.4. 

Multiple instances of Accelerate are redundant.

Action is functionally short for the following: 

718.1.c.1. 

On Spells and Units: "This can be played during showdowns on any player's turn."

On Rune, Legend, or Permanent Abilities: "This can be activated during showdowns on any player's turn." 

718.2. 

The card or effect with this keyword is not restricted to showdowns. This permission is inclusive of all other timings and options available to the ability as written or by default. 

718.3. 

Action does not alter the function of any instruction of the corresponding card or effect it is on. It is only permission. 

Example: Playing a **Unit** with Action still has the inherent restrictions of playing **Units** without Action. It can only be played to the controlling player's base or a battlefield they control. 

718.4. 

Action is a referencable characteristic. 

718.4.a.

719.1.d.1. 

Assault remains in effect as long as the Unit maintains the Attacker designation. 



719.2. 

If a Unit has Assault or has been granted Assault and is granted Assault by an additional source, the Assault Value of all granted Assault keywords is summed. 

Example: Petty Officer has Assault. It is chosen as the target of Cleave, which says 

"Give a unit \[Assault 3\] this turn." After Cleave resolves, Petty Officer has Assault 4 

this turn.

720.2. 

Each instance of Deathknell a Permanent may have will trigger separately. 

720.2.a. 

The controller will choose the order to add these **Triggers** to the chain.

721.1.d. 

It is an effect that imposes a Mandatory Additional Cost on Spells and Abilities that choose the permanent that has this ability. 

See **rule 554. Playing Cards** for more information. 

721.2. 

If a Unit has Deflect, or has been granted Deflect, and is granted Deflect by an additional source, the Deflect Value of all granted Deflect keywords is summed.

## **Hidden**

723.1. 

Hidden is a keyword that acts as a prerequisite to perform the **Hide** Discretionary Action. 

723.1.a. 

It is present on Spells, Units, and Gear. 

723.1.b. 

It is functionally short for "Rather than play this, you may pay \[C\] to hide this facedown at a battlefield you control that doesn't already have a facedown card hidden there. Beginning on the next player's turn, this gains \[Reaction\] and you may play this, ignoring its base cost. All choices must only be picked from among valid targets at the battlefield associated with this Facedown Zone." 

723.1.b.1. 

The \[C\] Cost always matches the Domain Identity of the deck being played. 

It does not have to match the card being Hidden. 

723.1.c. 

It allows the player to take the Discretionary Action **Hide**. 

723.1.c.1. 

Hide is not a subset of **Play**. 

723.1.c.2. 

Hiding a card does not open a chain.

723.1.d.1. 

A card cannot be played from Hidden if there are no valid targets, just like a card cannot be played from hand without valid targets. 

723.2. 

A card with Hidden may still be played for its cost as normal, at its normal timing with no restrictions on targeting. 

723.3. 

Multiple instances of Hidden are redundant. 

723.4. 

Hidden, and whether or not a card has Hidden, is a characteristic of the card and may be checked or referenced by other **Game Effects. **

Starting from the Keyword to the end of the clause, the entire statement is the Legion Ability.It is functionally short for "If you have played another Main Deck card before this one already this turn, apply \[Text\]." 

724.1.c.1. 

This is called the Legion condition. 

724.1.c.2. 

Legion's conditional can apply to static abilities, activated abilities, spell instructions, or even abilities active in zones outside of the board. 

724.2. 

All instances of Legion on cards a player controls are satisfied by that player playing a single card. 

Example: One card has three different Legion Abilities. The Legion Text of all three abilities apply as long as one card has been played by the card's controller earlier in the same turn. 

724.3.

725.

"Give a unit \[Shield 3\] and \[Tank\] this turn." After Block resolves, Stalwart Poro has Shield 4 this turn.
