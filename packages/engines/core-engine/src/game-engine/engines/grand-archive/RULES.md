Grand Archive Comprehensive Rules v1.1.1

**General Rules - Objectives**

Grand Archive is a game that is played between two or more players. 

The primary objective of the game is to win by defeating each opponent’s champion. 

1. If a game state results in each player in a two-player game losing at the same time, the game result is designated as a draw for each player. 

2. If a game state results in each player in a multiplayer game losing at the same time at the end of a game, the game result is designated as a draw for each player. 

3. Players in a multiplayer game who individually lost earlier in the game before the point of a draw between remaining players are still considered to have lost and are not awarded a draw. 

Each player should provide their own deck for formal matches. 

3. In casual games, it is acceptable for a player to be lent a deck by another player. 

14

18/06/2025, 20:36

Grand Archive Comprehensive Rules v1.1.1

**General Rules - Players**

Basic rules covering the "player" role in Grand Archive During a turn in a game of Grand Archive, players are designated as the turn player and non-turn players. 

1. The turn player is the player controlling the turn, the passage of phases during the turn, and the events that take place during the main phases within the turn. 

2. The turn player may perform slow player actions at any time during their main phase while the Effects Stack is empty. 

Players may activate abilities or play cards at fast speed when they have Opportunity. 

3. Non-turn players can't perform Slow Player Actions at any time. 

When the turn ends, the turn player ceases to be the turn player, and the next player in the turn order immediately becomes the turn player. 

A multiplayer game is considered any game that includes 3 or more players. 

15

18/06/2025, 20:36

Grand Archive Comprehensive Rules v1.1.1

**General Rules - Starting the Game**

Steps taken to start a game of Grand Archive, including Turn One Step 1: Each player places their material deck and main deck in the appropriate zones Step 2: Each player shuffles their main deck to ensure it is sufficiently randomized Step 3: Players present their main decks to their opponents to shuffle and/or cut Step 4: Players determine the first turn player. This may be done through any random method that all players agree to. 

The first player takes their first turn. 

**Turn One**

Each player’s first turn follows a modified turn order: The turn player skips their Wake Up, Materialize, and Recollection phases, and places a Level 0 champion from the Material Deck onto the field. 

In a two-player game, the first turn player also skips their Draw Phase. 

16

18/06/2025, 20:36

Grand Archive Comprehensive Rules v1.1.1

**General Rules - Ending the Game**

A game of Grand Archive ends when a player wins or when the game ends in a draw. 

A player wins the game when:

• All opponents’ champions die, OR

• All opponents did not control a champion when a player receives Opportunity and those players previously controlled a champion, OR

• All of the player’s opponents have lost the game, OR

• An effect states that the player has won the game. 

A player loses the game when:

• Their champion dies, OR

• The player does not control a champion when a player receives Opportunity and previously controlled a champion, OR

• That player attempts to draw a card from an empty deck, OR

• An effect states that the player has lost the game, OR

• They concede, OR

• They would win and lose simultaneously. 

A game ends in a draw when:

• An effect states the game is a draw, OR

• All remaining players lose or win the game simultaneously. 

When a player loses a game, all cards and objects owned by that player are removed from the game and returned to that player. All face-down cards with specified properties or characteristics \(i.e. those beyond simply being a card\), those cards are all revealed \(they become face-up and revealed to all players before that player may add those cards to their original decks for shuffling\). See here for information on properties. 

1. In a multiplayer game, if that player controlled another player’s object\(s\) and that object\(s\) did not have a previous controller, that object will immediately cease to exist 17

18/06/2025, 20:36

Grand Archive Comprehensive Rules v1.1.1

in the current match. Otherwise, the object will return under the control of its previous controller. 

2. An object ceasing to exist as a result of a player losing the game will not be considered to have died, be destroyed, be banished, or have any other change of game state applied to it other than the object having left the field of play. 

E.g. If that object has an “On Leave” ability or would trigger an ability of another object observing that object to leave play, only those abilities will trigger. 

After a game, all cards and objects owned are then returned to their respective owners. 

If playing a game within a match structure, main deck and material deck cards are reshuffled in their respective decks, and tokens are set aside. 

18

18/06/2025, 20:36

Grand Archive Comprehensive Rules v1.1.1

**General Rules - Format Conventions**

Each standard constructed game of Grand Archive is played between two players, each with their own main deck and material decks. 

1. Main decks can have a minimum of 60 cards and a maximum of four copies of a card with the same name. 

2. Material decks can have a maximum of 12 cards and a maximum of one copy of a card with the same name. 

3. Material decks must contain a Level 0 champion at minimum. 

4. Sideboards contain a maximum of 15 cards. Sideboards use a 15 point system where cards in the Main Deck are worth 1 point and Regalia/Champion cards are worth 3 

points. Sideboards can consist of any combination of Main Deck cards and Regalia/Champion cards that does not exceed 15 points or 15 cards for the Sideboard. 

Each standard draft game of Grand Archive is played between two players, each with their own main deck and material decks. 

5. Main decks can have a minimum 30-count main deck. Maxmimum limits on copies of cards are draft format-specific. 

6. Material decks are limited to a deck size of 10 and must contain at least one Level 0 

champion. 

7. Your sideboard consists of all cards in your pool. 

Card names, costs, and their elements must exactly match a corresponding card in the Grand Archive Index to be considered legal for deck building. 

8. In non-sanctioned matches, a card whose information \(such as name, cost, element, etc.\) is modified to that of another card may be treated as if it is the card the modified card would represent \(if such a card exists within the Index\). 

9. The effects of a given card will behave based on the listed rules and effects of the corresponding card in the Index, regardless of the text box of the card or any modifications therein. 

Tournament structures including match structures, sideboarding rules, round time limits, etc. are not covered in the GA comprehensive rules and are discussed in a separate 19

Grand Archive Comprehensive Rules v1.1.1

**General Rules - Parts of a Card**

Cards consist of components of Name, Cost, Type, Class, Element, Speed, Power, Life, Durability, and Rules Text which all define a card’s characteristics. All cards have a Name, Cost, Type, Class, and Element. 

Cards with a Class Bonus ability have watermark icons that correspond to the classes of the card and for which champion classes that Class Bonus is unlocked. These icons do not affect gameplay. 

The following pages discuss these topics:

• Name

• Cost

• Typeline

• Element

• Speed

• Power and Life

• Durability

• Text Box

• Border Information

21

18/06/2025, 20:36

Grand Archive Comprehensive Rules v1.1.1

**Parts of a Card - Name**

The name of the card will be found in the middle section of the top bar between the card cost and the card element. 

Card names are unique. 

1. Named lineages are specified to determine a type of champion card. For example, all forms of Rai champion cards are part of the Rai lineage. 

2. If a card must be named or a card of a chosen name is specified for an effect, the full name of the card must be specified. 

a. Shortcutting the name of the card can be achieved if the intended card to be named can be sufficiently described such that each player in the game understands the card intending to be named without ambiguity. If shortcutting is not possible due to a lack of mutual understanding, the player naming a card will provide the full name of the intended card. \(Players can use the Index for assistance at any time.\) b. The corresponding card may be indicated or represented in the Index. 

22

18/06/2025, 20:36

Grand Archive Comprehensive Rules v1.1.1

**Parts of a Card - Cost**

The basic cost of the card is denoted on the top left corner of a card. 

Costs are either reserve costs or memory costs; Reserve costs are represented with a yellow color while Memory costs are represented with a blue color. 

A champion’s memory cost is located beneath its printed level. 

The “cost” of a card when referred to in its rules text refers to the cost type reflected in that card. 

If the number is a reserve cost, it represents the number of cards that must be placed into the Memory zone face-down from that player’s hand and reserved until the next recollection as payment for that cost. 

To pay for a reserve cost, select X other cards from your hand where X is the cost required to activate the desired card and place them into your Memory zone face-down. 

If the number is a memory cost, the cost must be paid by banishing randomly selected cards from the Memory zone. 

1. To pay for a Memory cost, X cards are randomly selected from the Memory zone where X is the Memory cost to materialize the desired card. 

2. Non-random forms of payment for a given cost are paid before random costs are paid. 

3. This may only be done during the Materialize phase. 

4. No Opportunity is given to players and no player actions may be taken between the time cards are chosen for payment of a memory cost and the time at which those cards are banished. 

If there are any additional costs for the activation or the materialization of cards or for activating abilities, these must be paid at the same time the normal costs are paid before the card or effect enters the Effects Stack. 

23

18/06/2025, 20:36

Grand Archive Comprehensive Rules v1.1.1

If a card or effect would specify a cost as a result of the card resolving, payment of these costs follows the rules text and timing therein. 

Effects and abilities can modify costs to be paid. 

5. To calculate the required cost, simultaneously add the numeric value of any cost increases applied by any modifying effects and subtract the numeric values of any cost decreases applied by any modifying effects. The result is the numeric cost required to be paid. 

6. Reduction and increases of costs change the default cost type for cards by reducing or increasing that cost type, respectively. Default costs are reserve costs for main deck cards and memory costs for material deck cards. 

7. Costs cannot be reduced below 0. If a cost would be reduced to a number below 0, that cost is set to 0 instead. 

If a card has a variable cost represented by X, X is treated as 0 while the card is not on the Effects Stack. Otherwise, X is treated as whichever number was chosen as X as it was placed on the Effects Stack. 

8. If a card with a variable cost in the Effects Stack is copied, the copied instance will assume the value of X chosen for the original card. 

9. If a card with a variable cost is allowed to be played without paying for its reserve or memory cost, X must be chosen as 0; players may not choose any other values for X in this case. 

10. References to the value X as part of the effects of a card or object will be treated as the previously chosen value of X. 

11. If an effect copies object on the field with any values of X among its costs or of a previously set value for X, the copy will be made with those values of X set to 0. 

24

18/06/2025, 20:36

Grand Archive Comprehensive Rules v1.1.1

**Parts of a Card - Typeline**

Cards have a card type listed on the left side of the middle segment of the card in the typeline. 

The types are Champion, Ally,  Action, Attack,  Weapon, Domain, Item, and Phantasia. 

• Champion cards have a life stat. 

• Ally cards have both a power and a life stat. 

• Action cards have a speed stat. 

• Weapon cards have a power and a durability stat. 

• Attack cards have a power stat. 

Ally, Action, Weapon, and Attack cards generally have class subtyping. 

1. A class subtype will be the first subtype listed on the typeline. 

2. Cards can have multiple subtypes with multiple class subtypes divided by a “/” on the card. 

3. Cards can be activated regardless of class typing. 

E.g., a player can activate Assassin cards even if their champion is a Warrior. 

Cards sometimes have characteristic subtyping such as “Reaction,” “Skill,” “Harmony,” or 

“Melody.” These characteristics may be referenced by abilities as conditions for certain effects. 

25

18/06/2025, 20:36

Grand Archive Comprehensive Rules v1.1.1

**Parts of a Card - Element**

All cards have an element denoted in the top right of the card. 

The element specified on the card must be enabled for a player for that player to play that card. 

The norm element is unlocked innately for all players. 

Non-norm elements are unlocked innately depending on the elements of champion cards within the lineage \(see Lineage\); non-champion cards do not unlock elements. 

E.g. A player has a lineage containing a Spirit of Water, norm champions, and an arcane champion, that player may play or activate norm, water, and arcane cards. 

Champion cards are not bound by element restrictions when materializing. 

E.g. a player may materialize a Level 3 champion with the crux element type without previously having the crux element enabled as long as the other rules for leveling up that champion are followed. 

Basic elements are Fire, Water, and Wind elements; Advanced elements are any elements that are not Fire, Water, Wind, or Norm. 

26

18/06/2025, 20:36

Grand Archive Comprehensive Rules v1.1.1

**Parts of a Card - Speed**

Cards \(typically actions\) have a written speed stat denoted as either Fast or Slow on the bottom right of the card. 

The speed stat of a card determines the timing rules and restrictions that activating that card must follow. 

27

18/06/2025, 20:36

Grand Archive Comprehensive Rules v1.1.1

**Parts of a Card - Power and Life**

Champions and allies have a life stat denoted on the bottom right of the card designated with a heart icon. 

Ally, weapon, and attack cards have a power stat denoted on the bottom right of the card designated with a sword icon. 

28

18/06/2025, 20:36

Grand Archive Comprehensive Rules v1.1.1

**Parts of a Card - Durability**

Some cards have a durability stat noted on the bottom right side of the card designated with a shield icon. The durability of an object refers to the number of durability counters it currently has. 

1. The durability stat correlates to how many uses that card has or how many attacks a weapon may be used in. Attacking removes a durability counter as combat ends 2. An object enters the field with durability counters equal to its durability stat. 

3. More durability counters may be placed on an object than the durability stat. 

29

18/06/2025, 20:36

Grand Archive Comprehensive Rules v1.1.1

**Parts of a Card - Text Box**

The text box of each card is reserved for rules text as well as flavor text. Rules text is written in non-italicized font and any reminder texts or flavor texts are written in an italicized font. 

1. All non-italicized text constitutes card abilities and/or effects. 

2. Line breaks for effects and abilities separate independent abilities. Triggered abilities separated by line breaks are treated as separate triggers; a triggered ability without line breaks is considered a single ability. 

3. The only text used for consideration of effects and gameplay is non-italicized. 

a. Reminder text functions to remind players of keyword definitions or intention for effect resolution. 

b. Italicized text apart from label keywords has no impact on gameplay. 

4. Yellow bubbles with numerals can be used to represent reserve costs, either as costs for abilities or as costs as part of an effect. 

Names of some cards may be shortened within its rules text. Instances of a shortened name in this fashion are treated as if it were the full name of the card. 

30

18/06/2025, 20:36

Grand Archive Comprehensive Rules v1.1.1

**Parts of a Card - Border Information**

At the bottom edge of each card will be left-justified information regarding \(in order\): Set of printing, print edition, print language, card/collector number in the respective set, set printed rarity, and art illustrator, as well as right-justified information regarding copyright information/print year. 

Border information does not impact gameplay.

Grand Archive Comprehensive Rules v1.1.1

**Card Types - Champion**

Champion is also an object type. 

Champion cards start in the material deck. 

A Level 0 Spirit champion card must be put onto the field on each player’s first turn. This is treated as a special game action and cannot be responded to. 

Players may not materialize Level 0 champions. 

**Leveling Up**: A champion can be incrementally leveled by placing the next level champion card on top of that champion’s “lineage. " The next level champion is placed on top of the previous level champion. This is known as leveling up the champion. Leveling a champion can be as a result of materializing a champion card during the materialize phase or as a result of effects that instruct a player to “level up”  their champion. 

See: Lineage

1. Champions are leveled by a player when a champion whose base level is N\+1 is selected from the material deck and played, usually by selection for materialization with memory costs paid. N refers to the printed level of one of that player’s champion cards on the field and does not consider additional level modifying effects. 

E.g. Lorraine, Wandering Warrior is a Level 1 champion regardless of how many effects that state “your champion gets \+X level” and can level up into a valid Level 2 champion from the material deck. 

2. Players ignore element requirements/restrictions when materializing a champion or leveling a champion up. 

E.g. A player who controls Lorraine, Blademaster with a Spirit of Fire in the Lineage may still level up the champion into Lorraine, Crux Knight without previously having the Crux element enabled.

Grand Archive Comprehensive Rules v1.1.1

3. Leveling up a champion requires a player to place the new champion card on top of the existing champion card as part of the lineage. It keeps the same rested/awake property. 

I.e., if a rested champion levels up, it will remain rested. 

4. Leveling up a champion does not use the effects stack. If a champion card is materialized, leveling up will happen as a result of the resolution of the champion card. 

5. The entire stack of cards consisting of a Champion and the cards in the “Inner Lineage” 

in its entirety is referred to as the “Lineage.” 

6. Only the top card of the lineage is treated as an object, i.e. the Champion, and all inherited effects within the “Inner Lineage”  cards apply to the Champion. 

a. The Champion is considered the champion object that is on the field. 

b. A new champion card being placed on top of the original champion does not count as a new object entering the field. It will still count as a new champion card entering the lineage. Therefore, the addition of that card to the lineage will trigger any On Enter abilities of the topmost champion card in the lineage. 

i. When a champion leaves or enters the field, it will do so with all cards within its inner lineage lineage as well as its counters \(Enlighten, Level, etc.\). 

ii. The element identity of the champion consists of all elements among champion cards within the lineage. 

iii. If a new object were to replace the current champion and its lineage, no attributes of that lineage carry over, such as enlighten counters or damage counters. 

iv. Only Inherited Effects from among cards in the lineage will contribute to the effects and abilities of the champion of the lineage; any other characteristics from the inner lineage such as card name, cost, class identity, types, non-Inherited Effect abilities, life stats, and power stats are ignored. 

7. Players can only level up champions they control. 

8. Players can't play nor level up champions they do not meet leveling requirements for. 

**Deleveling**: A player may delevel a champion as a cost or as a result of an effect or certain abilities. For a player to delevel a champion, that player takes the top-most champion card in that champion’s lineage and returns it to the Material deck. 

Champions can attack only through attack cards or by using weapons. Most champions do not inherently have a power stat and, therefore, can't inherently attack or retaliate against attacks. 

34

18/06/2025, 20:36

Grand Archive Comprehensive Rules v1.1.1

9. Attacking rests a champion as a cost, either from activation of an attack card or by an attack declaration through a weapon. 

a. Attack declarations made as a result of an attack card entering the Intent do not rest as a cost. 

b. Champions with power stats may declare an attack without an attack card or weapon, just as units can. 

Champions statically enable non-norm elements for the controlling player. Champion cards in a lineage will grant a player access to all elements included among their element types. 

Champion names for lineages will typically be considered without prefixes, suffixes, titles, epithets, or any other naming ornamentation for the card. 

If a Champion card would be put into a graveyard from anywhere, it is instead banished. 

35

18/06/2025, 20:36

Grand Archive Comprehensive Rules v1.1.1

**Card Types - Ally**

Ally objects are ally units, are attackable, and can be the target or choice for effects. 

Ally cards can only be played at slow speed. 

Ally objects enter the field awake. 

Ally objects may attack while awake. 

Ally objects may retaliate when attacked, if they are awake. 

An ally card goes to its owner’s graveyard when the ally object is destroyed. Allies with 0 life or less, or an amount of damage marked equal to or greater than their life stats will automatically be destroyed as a result of state-based effects before any player can take any player actions. 

36

18/06/2025, 20:36

Grand Archive Comprehensive Rules v1.1.1

**Card Types - Action**

An action card can be activated at the speed specified on the card. 

Targets of an action card must be specified when the card is activated. 

Action cards and their effects are invalidated if all necessary targets specified by the action card are invalid or illegal for targeting. This is also known as "fizzling. " Optional targets \(such as “up to <number>”\) do not count towards fulfilling necessary or required targeting conditions. 

When activated, action cards are placed on the Effects Stack before resolving. 

After the action card resolves or fizzles, it will go to the graveyard. 

37

18/06/2025, 20:36

Grand Archive Comprehensive Rules v1.1.1

**Card Types - Attack**

Attack is also an intent type. 

Attack cards can only be played at slow speed and rests the champion as an additional playing cost. 

Attack cards become declared attacks after they enter the intent. 

Attacks \(as an intent\) may be used together with a weapon. 

Once an attack card is activated, it is placed onto the Effects Stack where it can then resolve. 

1. If the attack card is negated, the attack card goes to the graveyard, no damage is dealt, and the champion remains rested. 

2. Once an attack card resolves, it is placed from the Effects Stack into a champion’s intent zone and is then referred to as the attack until the Combat Phase that was started ends. 

After an attack card resolves, the player that activated it must declare an attack to a legal attack target, if possible, and a combat phase immediately begins. If no such target exists, the attack will fizzle and no attack declaration will be made. 

3. Damage from the attack card is dealt simultaneously with all other combat damage during the Damage Step. No player receives Opportunity and no actions may be taken nor any events may occur during the time this process is completed. 

Attack cards will go to the graveyard during the End of Combat step of the Combat Phase. 

38

18/06/2025, 20:36

Grand Archive Comprehensive Rules v1.1.1

**Card Types - Item**

Item is also an object type. 

Items have reserve costs in the main deck. If they are in the material deck, item cards have the regalia supertype and will have memory costs instead of reserve costs. 

Items may only be played at slow speed. 

Items go to their owner's graveyard when they are destroyed. 

39

18/06/2025, 20:36

Grand Archive Comprehensive Rules v1.1.1

**Card Types - Weapon**

Weapon is also an object type. 

Weapons have reserve costs in the main deck. If they are in the material deck, weapon cards have the regalia supertype and will have memory costs instead of reserve costs. 

Weapons may only be played at slow speed. 

Weapon objects can allow a champion to attack. 

1. Allies cannot use weapons. 

2. Weapon cards have a power and durability stat. 

a. A weapon enters the field an object with durability counters equal to its printed durability stat. 

b. The durability of a weapon is the number of durability counters it currently has. 

c. When a weapon is used in an attack, a durability counter is removed in the damage step of the combat phase. Durability is still removed if the damage dealt is 0. 

Durability will not be lost if the damage step of combat is skipped. 

3. A weapon object is destroyed as a state-based action if the durability of that weapon reaches 0. 

a. Damage being prevented during the damage step by any effect does not prevent the weapon from losing durability. 

Weapons go to their owner’s graveyard when they are destroyed. 

40

18/06/2025, 20:36

Grand Archive Comprehensive Rules v1.1.1

**Card Types - Domain**

Domain is also an object type. 

Domains will go to the graveyard if they are destroyed. 

Domains may only be played at slow speed. 

41

18/06/2025, 20:36

Grand Archive Comprehensive Rules v1.1.1

**Card Types - Phantasia**

Phantasias is also an object type. 

Phantasias will go to the graveyard if they are destroyed. 

Phantasias may only be played at slow speed. 

42

18/06/2025, 20:36

Grand Archive Comprehensive Rules v1.1.1

**Card Types - Supertypes**

Cards have a supertype that may sometimes be listed that modifies rules for the card. 

Supertypes are dependent on the card type; if the card type is changed, the supertype will also be changed, either to the default of having no supertype or to whatever it is being set to. 

See Type Changing

1. Unique is a supertype that specifies that a player may only control 1 unique object on the field with that name at any time. If a player controls 2 or more unique objects with the same name, that player is forced to sacrifice any of those objects until they only control 1. This will be done when the game attempts to move to the next game state before any effects are resolved, Opportunity is passed, or the game would return to a player’s main phase. I.e, the game will only progress after the rule for unique objects is satisfied. 

a. If two objects on the field share the same name, but only one is unique, the game will not require the player to sacrifice one of those objects. 

2. Regalia is a supertype for cards that specifies that the card must start in the material deck. 

a. Deckbuilding restrictions for cards in the material deck apply to regalia as well; a player may only have up to one copy of a specific regalia in their material deck at the start of a game. 

b. All regalia have a memory cost. 

c. If a regalia card would be put into a graveyard from anywhere, it is instead banished. 

d. If an effect specifies that a regalia would be sent to the hand, main deck, or memory it returns to its owner’s material deck when it leaves the field instead. 

43

18/06/2025, 20:36

Grand Archive Comprehensive Rules v1.1.1

**Card Types - Functional Subtypes**

Some subtypes of cards are functional. That is, they might have specific rules that pertain to how the card can function differently from or in addition to the rules of the card type. 

**Functional Domains**

## 1. Siegeable

a. "Siegeable" is a subtype modifier for domains that allows them to be declared as attack targets. 

i. Siegeable domains are not units and can't die. 

ii. Cards that target a unit will not be able to target a Siegable domain unless it is a type of unit in addition to its other types. 

iii. Attacks with Cleave will include siegeable domains in the set of defending objects on attack declarations. 

iv. Siegeable domains can't be chosen as an attack target as long as there is a legal object with Taunt is in play that must be attacked first. 

b. Siegeable domains have an innate durability stat that determines how many durability counters that domain will enter the field with. 

i. Whenever a siegeable domain would take damage, that many durability counters are removed from the domain. 

ii. On Hit abilities will still consider the damage as dealt even if it is not marking damage in any form. 

iii. Siegeable domains will be destroyed as a state-based effect if it has no remaining durability counters \(its durability reaches zero\). 

**Functional Items**

1. Bullet / Arrow

a. Bullet and Arrow are a functional item subtypes with a power stat. 

**Functional Weapons**

1. Gun / Bow

44

18/06/2025, 20:36

Grand Archive Comprehensive Rules v1.1.1

a. Gun and Bow are functional weapon subtypes. They must be “Loaded” to be used for an attack. 

b. Attacks can’t be declared with weapons of these types in conjunction with attack cards. 

See Loaded Cards; an object that has been Loaded will put all of its Loaded Cards into the Intent when it is used during attack declarations.\)

45

18/06/2025, 20:36

Grand Archive Comprehensive Rules v1.1.1

**General Rules - Card Characteristics**

A characteristic of a card or object is any part of the card that can be referenced by effect text or the game. Characteristics can include:

• Element

• Cost

• Types \(including supertypes and subtypes\)

• Abilities

• Stats \(power, life, durability\)

• Speed \(fast, slow\)

• Name

Characteristics do not include properties or states. 

**Type-Overwriting and Type-setting**

1. If an effect sets an object's typing to a specified type, it will replace the originally noted typing. Any typing not modified is retained, such as subtyping. 

2. If the specified overwriting sets the card type, it will also lose its supertypes. 

Supertypes must be redefined whenever a card’s type is set or overridden. 

E.g. Triskit, Angel of Guidance loses the original Unique Ally typing if a player accepts the On Enter ability and will instead become a Unique Champion. Subtyping is conserved and Triskit will still be a Warrior Angel. 

46



18/06/2025, 20:36

Grand Archive Comprehensive Rules v1.1.1

**Type-Acting**

1. If an effect states that an object may perform an action “as though it were \[object type\],” 

it will not set not overwrite its own type to match that as the type it is acting as. 

2. These effects may allow objects to behave as other object types but will not innately change their own type nor the targeting, damage, timing, and other attributes specific to its own type. 

3. Card effects will generally specify what behavior is granted in the effect text. 

**Type-Expansion**

1. If an effect confers additional types to an object or card, it will then have all attributes of all of its card types without duplication of any overlapping attributes or behaviors. 

2. If any characteristics overlap where their rules conflict, such as being sent to banishment versus graveyard when being destroyed, the more restrictive characteristics applies \(banishment being more restrictive than the graveyard as a designated zone\). 

47

18/06/2025, 20:36

Grand Archive Comprehensive Rules v1.1.1

**Stat-Setting**

1. If an effect were to set or establish a card or object's stat \(such as power, or life\) where that card or object did not previously have such a stat, it is initially given that stat with a default value of 0 before any stat-setting is applied. 

48

18/06/2025, 20:36

Grand Archive Comprehensive Rules v1.1.1

**Double-faced Cards**

In Grand Archive, some cards exist that have two faces, or two sides, each with separate characteristics as opposed to a single side of information and rules text with an information-less card back. Double-faced cards have no card back and instead have another full card face with characteristics and rules text. The default side of the card is modified such that the reserve or memory cost icon reflects which side of the side is being examined, in addition to an embossed upward-pointing arrow in the bottom left of the card. To flip a card to the flip side during a game, the rules text will typically tell a player to "transform" 

the card as a player action. Transform is the player action that means to flip a card to the other side. The flip side is denoted by the embossed downward-pointing arrow in the reserve or memory cost bubble in addition to a solid downward-point arrow on the bottom left of its text box. There is only one type of double-faced card in Grand Archive, currently. 

1. Double-faced cards must be played on their default side initially. This side is represented by the typical reserve and memory cost icons found on regular, non-double-faced cards. The side with the modified symbol \(shown by an embossed arrow on "Fatebound" or "Fatestone"-subtyped cards printed in Abyssal Heaven\) can't be played. If a card is currently on the flip side on the field, it is considered "transformed" 

\(and has the transformed property\). 

2. Only the characteristics \(rules text, abilities, stats, name, type, etc.\) on the face-up side are considered for game actions and evaluating the game state. While not on the field, only the default face of the card is considered for characteristics in all other zones. 

a. If a transformed double-faced card is moved from the field to any other zone, it must be physically flipped back to the default side. Last-known information will still consider any characteristics of the transformed side, if applicable. 

b. If a transformed double-face card has a different type than the type on the default side that would change the rules about which zone it would be moved to, it would move to the zone corresponding with the appropriate rules applied to the default side of the card. 

E.g. If Seiryuu, an ally with a reserve cost is destroyed by any effect, the default side of the card, Fabled Azurite Fatestone, is examined when determining which zone the card would be placed in. In this context, "Seiryuu" would be placed in Banishment, flipped back to its default side as the Fatestone. Similarly, if an effect attempts to move Seiryuu to the hand, memory, or main deck, it will instead be returned to the material deck as Fabled Azurite Fatestone, a regalia item. 

49





18/06/2025, 20:36

Grand Archive Comprehensive Rules v1.1.1

3. If a player has knowledge permissions associated with a double-faced card \(i.e., that card is either public or private to that player\) they may examine either side of the card by flipping it. 

50

18/06/2025, 20:36

Grand Archive Comprehensive Rules v1.1.1

a. Flipping it in this way will not be considered a transformation. 

4. If a double-faced card is copied, only the characteristics of the present side are copied. 

a. If a card copies the characteristics of a transformed card, the copy will share the characteristics of that card in its transformed state. 

b. Copies of transformed cards cannot themselves transform. If a player attempts to transform a copy of a card that is either transformed or can be transformed, nothing will happen, and the action is skipped. Any costs paid will not be "refunded." 

51





18/06/2025, 20:36

Grand Archive Comprehensive Rules v1.1.1

E.g. If a player banishes a Clockwork Amalgam that has copied Suzaku, a transformed ally, and opts to pay for the On Banish ability, Clockwork Amalgam will stay banished as it is not itself a double-faced card and can't transform. 

52

18/06/2025, 20:36

Grand Archive Comprehensive Rules v1.1.1

5. Double-faced cards can still be considered "face-down." In this situation, a placeholder card with a default Grand Archive card back should be used to represent the card. A face-down double-faced card will not be considered transformed, will have no characteristics other than being a card, and should be treated as a non-double-faced Grand Archive card. The use of opaque sleeves are suitable for hiding the back of a double-faced card, and the opaque card back may be used to treat the card as "face-down." 

6. Transforming a double-faced card does not cause it to become a new object, however, any static abilities that are now active as a result of the transformation will receive a new timestamp. 

a. Any continuous effects that previously applied to the default side, will continue to apply to the transformed card, if applicable. 

7. When choosing a card name for any effects, the name of the transformed card may be used. Only cards with the chosen name will have that effect applied to them, regardless of the name on the other side of the card.

**Game Mechanics - Game Zones**

A game zone is a physical zone in the play area where cards are placed. There are 9 total zones in Grand Archive: Main Deck, Material Deck,  Hand, Memory,  Field,  Graveyard,  

Banishment,  Intent,  and the Effects Stack. 

The Field and Effects stack are the only zones shared by all players and control of specific cards and objects in these zones are specified while in these zones. 

Cards in zones can have one of two visibility states: face-up or face-down. Face-up cards present their card front up towards all players whereas face-down cards present their card back up towards all players. Face-down cards typically have hidden information from some or all players in the game. 

Cards can only exist in one zone at a time and will always be in a zone during a game. If a card is not in a zone, it is not considered part of the game. 

If a card changes zones, it is considered to only be in the zone it was moved to after it is moved. 

1. A card’s zone changes only if the destination zone is different from the zone it was moved from. 

2. If a card in a private zone is moved to a public zone, it is turned face-up by default. If a card in a public zone is moved to a private zone, it is turned face-down by default. 

A card changing zones or object changing zones is considered public information that is passively available to the game state. This information is typically only important when referenced by an effect or ability

E.g. If a card enters the Graveyard from the Main Deck, the game will know that this has happened, but it may not be important. If a card or object has a triggered ability in such an event, it will become relevant and the triggered ability will be placed onto the Effects Stack. 

Some information is carried by cards \(or the objects they may become\) when a card changes zones. 

55

18/06/2025, 20:36

Grand Archive Comprehensive Rules v1.1.1

1. Abilities or effects granted to card activation or the object that card activation would become allow the related information to cross over the last known zone after a zone was changed. 

2. Abilities of objects can reference information about the activations that created those objects as they were resolved, including what costs were paid to activate that object and what properties that card activation had as it was resolving. 

3. Objects can track and reference the cards that were used to pay for their activation and/or materialization costs. 

The list, number, and properties of face-up cards in public zones are countable and itemizable by every player in a game. 

The order of cards in every zone except the Main Deck and Effects Stack can be changed; players can’t change the order of cards in the Main Deck or Effects Stack. 

If an effect specifies to do an action to a zone, that action affects all cards in that zone equally. 

Zones other than the Main Deck and Material Deck generally start the game empty; no cards are in those zones at the start of the game.

Grand Archive Comprehensive Rules v1.1.1

**Game Zones - Public**

**vs Private Information**

A public zone is a zone where cards are visible face-up by default \(card face is turned up\) and a private zone is a zone where cards are visible face-down by default \(card face is turned down; card back is face-up\). 

1. A card’s visibility in a zone may be different from the default visibility in that zone. 

2. Cards in zones that are private have no characteristics apart from being cards by default. 

a. If a card with a specified characteristic is added to a private zone, that card must be revealed before it is added to that zone. This does not apply for moving cards to a public zone but with hidden or private information. 

57





18/06/2025, 20:36

Grand Archive Comprehensive Rules v1.1.1

E.g. The Cosmic Bolts generated from Polaris must first be revealed to all players in a game before being shuffled into the Main Deck. This is not true of Quicksilver Grail since the Banishment is a public zone, even though the card added is face-down and considered private. 

58

18/06/2025, 20:36

Grand Archive Comprehensive Rules v1.1.1

Face-up cards, their attributes, properties, stats, rules text, and other information are considered public. 

A player may look at and examine any face-up cards in a game. If a card is moved this way, it must be returned to the zone it is in and in the same orientation. 

Players can’t hide any information about face-up cards or misrepresent information about face-up cards. 

All cards in a lineage or similar stack of cards are considered face-up. 

Face-down cards are considered private information known only to the player who currently controls that card. 

3. Except for cards in the main deck and unknown face-down cards in banishment, all other face-down cards may be looked at by their controlling player at any time. If an effect banished cards from a zone face-down and gave a specific player certain permissions for that card, such as activation or materialization, those cards are considered private for that player. 

a. When a card becomes private in a public zone \(e.g., banishment\), and that card was visible to a player due to that card being public information, that player will retain private information about that card and may look at that card. If an ability of that card would grant play permissions, that player can exercise the play permissions on that card.

18/06/2025, 20:36

Grand Archive Comprehensive Rules v1.1.1



E.g. If a player who controls Gaia's Blessing and owns Three Visits were to have Three Visits banished by their opponent's Tristan, Shadowreaver, the player who owns Three Visits will still retain the ability to activate it from banishment, as it was previously public information through Gaia's Blessing. 

4. If the control of a face-down card changes, neither the owner nor the former controller of that card can look at that card. 

5. Face-down cards have no characteristics except for being considered a card. 

6. Cards in all zones except for the Main Deck, Material Deck, Memory, and Hand are face-up by default. 

61

18/06/2025, 20:36

Grand Archive Comprehensive Rules v1.1.1

**Game Zones - Main Deck**

The Main Deck is a private zone owned by a player. Each player has their own Main Deck. 

The Main Deck zone can be referred to by the terms “deck” or “main deck.” 

Cards in each player’s Main Deck will start in their respective Main Deck zones. 

The deck must be maintained in a single, uniform pile. 

Players can’t look at or change the order of cards in their deck. 

Each deck must start the game in a randomized state. 

A player may only shuffle their deck when instructed to do so by an effect or in-between games to randomize the deck. 

A player may not look through any decks while in the game and may only look through their deck in between games. 

Players can only draw cards from the deck. 

If an effect instructs a player to play with the top card of the deck revealed, the top card must always be revealed. If a player is drawing multiple cards within one action sequence, each card drawn from the deck must be revealed. 

62

18/06/2025, 20:36

Grand Archive Comprehensive Rules v1.1.1

**Game Zones - Material Deck**

The Material Deck is a private zone owned by a player. Each player has their own Material Deck zone. 

The Material Deck zone is referred to by the term “material deck.” 

A player’s starting material deck starts the game in the Material Deck zone. 

Cards in the material deck must be kept in a single, uniform pile. 

The material deck must have at least one Level 0 champion card. 

Constructed formats require that the material deck only contains unique copies of cards. 

Players may look at their own material deck at any time. 

63

18/06/2025, 20:36

Grand Archive Comprehensive Rules v1.1.1

**Game Zones - Field**

The Field zone is a public zone shared by all players and has no owner. 

The Field zone is referred to by the term “field.” 

Objects a player controls are typically kept in front of them on the field with their text facing that player. 

Items, Weapons, Allies, Champions, Domains, and Phantasia enter the field as objects after they resolve. 

All cards on the field are considered objects. 

Objects enter the field awake. 

64

18/06/2025, 20:36

Grand Archive Comprehensive Rules v1.1.1

**Game Zones - Memory**

The Memory zone is a private zone owned by a player. Each player has their own Memory zone. 

The Memory zone is referred to by the term “memory." 

Any card that is sent to memory is sent to its owner’s memory. 

Cards in a player's memory zone will go back to its owner\(s\) hand\(s\) during that player's Recollection Phase. 

65

18/06/2025, 20:36

Grand Archive Comprehensive Rules v1.1.1

**Game Zones - Graveyard**

The Graveyard zone is a public zone owned by a player. Each player has their own Graveyard zone. 

The Graveyard zone is referred to by the term “graveyard.” 

Any card that would be sent to the graveyard is put into its owner’s graveyard. 

Cards in the graveyard must be kept in a single, uniform pile. 

Any card that is negated,  destroyed,  discarded,  or sacrificed is put into its owner’s graveyard. Action cards are placed into their owner’s graveyard after they resolve. Attack cards are placed into the graveyard from the intent during the End of Combat step. 

66

18/06/2025, 20:36

Grand Archive Comprehensive Rules v1.1.1

**Game Zones - Banishment**

The Banishment is a public zone owned by a player. Each player has their own Banishment zone. 

The Banishment zone is referred to by the term “banishment.” 

Any card that has been banished is put into its owner’s banishment. 

Cards in banishment must be kept in a single, uniform pile except for some cards asking that a player banish an object or card as part of an effect. 

1. The banished card may be tracked separately from the rest to represent this, but will still be in banishment. 

2. Temporarily banished cards may be represented near or adjacent to the banishment in a separate pile. 

3. If a card would refer to one or more of the cards banished under an effect of that card, it will only correspond to the card or cards banished under that card’s effect, not all or any other cards with the same card name as the source of the effect. 

E.g. If a player were to copy Tome of Sacred Lightning which was activated by banishing a Tome of Knowledge, the copied Tome of Sacred Lightning could not refer to the same Tome of Knowledge as a part of its effects since the copy could not have banished the same Tome of Knowledge.

**Game Zones - Hand**

The Hand is a private zoned owned by a player. Each player has their Hand zone. 

The Hand zone is referred to by the term “hand.” 

There is no maximum hand size. 

Any card that is sent to hand is sent to its owner’s hand.

Grand Archive Comprehensive Rules v1.1.1

**Game Zones - Effects Stack**

The Effects Stack zone is a public zone shared by all players and has no owner. 

The Effects Stack zone is referred to by the term “effects stack.” 

The Effects Stack contains an ordered collection of stacked card activations, materializations, and abilities pending resolution which uses a stacking structure. Each discrete item in this zone has its own layer and each layer will resolve on its own. The topmost layer is the first card to resolve any time an item in the effects stack were to resolve whereas the bottom layer corresponds to the item that would resolve last. In essence, this zone uses a first-in-last-out \(FILO\) system. 

Once a card or ability resolves from the Effects Stack, each of its effects will fully resolve as it is removed from the Effects Stack. 

E.g. Glacial Guidance will still grant an enlighten counter as it is ending the combat phase. 

70

18/06/2025, 20:36

Grand Archive Comprehensive Rules v1.1.1

Players can’t change the order of cards in the effects stack.

Grand Archive Comprehensive Rules v1.1.1

**Game Zones - Intent**

The Intent zone is a public zone, and each champion has an Intent zone owned by the champion’s controlling player that exists during the Combat Phase. 

The Intent Zone and all cards within that zone are referred to by the term “Intent.” 

All cards in the Intent are intents. Any card can, in theory, be sent to and exist in the intent. 

Cards in the intent are considered the source for any triggered or activated abilities from within the intent. 

72

18/06/2025, 20:36

Grand Archive Comprehensive Rules v1.1.1

**Game Zones - Object-Specific Zones**

Whenever an object leaves the field, all cards in its object-specific zones will be placed into the graveyard. 

If a card is a regalia, it is placed into the Banishment, instead. 

**Inner Lineage**

All cards stacked beneath the topmost champion in a lineage form the Inner Lineage. 

1. All cards within the inner lineage are not considered objects nor on the field and are only treated as cards. 

2. Each lineage has exactly one inner lineage. 

**Loaded Cards**

Each object having the Loaded property placed underneath another object is a part of the Loaded Cards of that object. 

1. All loaded cards are not considered objects nor on the field and are only treated as cards. 

2. When a Loaded object attacks or is used in an attack, it places each of its Loaded Cards into the Intent. 

3. Each object has its own loaded cards.

**Game Mechanics - Turn Order**

Turn order follows Wake Up, Materialize, Recollection, Draw, Main, and End phases. 

1. In a two-player game, the first turn player skips their first wake up, materialization, recollection, and draw phases, and instead puts a Level 0 champion into the field from their material deck and proceeds to their main phase. The second player skips their first wake up, materialization, and recollection phases, and instead puts a Level 0 champion into the field from their material deck before proceeding to their draw phase and then to their main phase. 

2. In a multiplayer game, the first turn player will follow the sequence of events as denoted for the second player in the above point, i.e. they will not skip their first draw phase. Each other player will also follow the same sequence of events for each of their first turns. 

The turn player receives Opportunity at the beginning of the Recollection phase, the Main phase, and the beginning of the End phase. These are the only non-combat phases in which the turn player will be given Opportunity naturally. 

A phase where players are given or gain Opportunity can end if and only if the Effects Stack is empty, all players have passed Opportunity in succession, and all events or actions associated with that phase are completed. 

If no players are given Opportunity in a phase, that phase instead ends after all phase actions are completed and the Effects Stack is empty. 

Any effects that last “until end of \[phase\]” end as that phase ends before the next phase begins. 

Any effects that trigger “at the beginning of \[phase\]” are triggered and placed onto the Effects Stack and the turn player gains Opportunity when that phase begins. 

Game events can’t happen between phases and steps; events will always happen in one of the discrete phases or steps within a phase. 

The following pages discuss these topics:

**Turn Order - Wake Up Phase**

1. During this phase, the game simultaneously wakes up each rested object on the field controlled by the turn player. This is a turn-based action and cannot be responded to. 

Units that are awake will not be considered to have woken. If an ability would put one or more triggered abilities onto the Effects Stack, the turn player gains Opportunity after each ability pending resolution is placed onto the Effects Stack. The phase will continue to the next step after the Effects Stack is empty. 

2. After each object that needed to be woken up is awake, the game will attempt to move to the Materialize phase. 

76

18/06/2025, 20:36

Grand Archive Comprehensive Rules v1.1.1

**Turn Order - Materialize Phase**

1. The materialize phase is skipped on each player’s first turn during a game. 

2. If an ability would put one or more triggered abilities onto the Effects Stack at the beginning of this phase, the turn player gains Opportunity after each ability pending resolution is placed onto the Effects Stack. The phase will continue to the materialization step \(3\) of this phase after the Effects Stack is empty. 

3. In this phase, the turn player may choose to materialize a card from their material deck as a turn-based action. Players may only materialize a regalia or champion card from their material deck during this phase. If a player opts to materialize in this way, it counts as a materialization where Opportunity is generated, and players may respond to the materialization. After this round of Opportunity has passed, no additional window to take actions will be generated apart from those from abilities pending resolution. 

4. After the Effects Stack is empty and all players have passed Opportunity in succession, the game will move to the Recollection phase. 

a. If the turn player did not materialize a card, no Opportunity will be given and the game will immediately move to the Recollection phase. 

Players are not naturally given Opportunity at the beginning of the Materialize Phase. 

Opportunity will only arise if the turn player opted to materialize a card or if there were any triggers placed on the effects stack during Step 2. If neither of these events happens, no Opportunity is generated, and the game will proceed to the Recollection phase. 

77

18/06/2025, 20:36

Grand Archive Comprehensive Rules v1.1.1

**Turn Order - Recollection Phase**

1. At the beginning of the recollection phase, any “beginning of recollection” abilities will enter the Effects Stack. 

2. After the Effects Stack is empty, the turn player will immediately gain Opportunity. This is the last time players may act before the recollection of cards in the memory zone will take place as a turn-based action. 

3. Then, after the Effects Stack is empty and all players have passed Opportunity in succession, the turn player returns all cards in their memory zone to their hand as a turn-based game action that can’t be responded to. This is called recollection. 

4. After the turn player finishes recollection, the game will move to the Draw phase. 

78

18/06/2025, 20:36

Grand Archive Comprehensive Rules v1.1.1

**Turn Order - Draw Phase**

1. First, the turn player immediately draws a card as a turn-based game action and cannot be responded to. 

2. After the card is drawn, the Effects Stack is empty, and all players have passed Opportunity in succession \(if Opportunity arose\) the game will attempt to move to the Main phase. 

79

18/06/2025, 20:36

Grand Archive Comprehensive Rules v1.1.1

**Turn Order - Main Phase**

1. First, the turn player receives Opportunity. 

2. During this phase, the turn player may perform any slow or fast player actions while they have Opportunity and the Effects Stack is empty or they may proceed to the end phase. 

3. Attacking is considered to be a slow player action and will immediately put the game through the combat phase. The game will return to the main phase after the end of combat. 

4. If any player actions were taken during the passing of Opportunity or any effects, activations, or materializations entered the Effects Stack, the turn player receives Opportunity after the Effects Stack becomes empty and the player can again perform slow or fast player actions. 

5. Non-turn players may only activate cards or take player actions at fast speed during this phase when they have Opportunity. 

6. If the Effects Stack is empty and no other player actions have been taken while Opportunity was being passed, the main phase ends and the game immediately proceeds to the end phase. 

80

18/06/2025, 20:36

Grand Archive Comprehensive Rules v1.1.1

**Turn Order - End Phase**

The end phase begins after the turn player chooses to end their main phase and proceed to the end phase. 

1. First, any effects that specify the “beginning of the end phase” are placed into the Effects Stack. 

2. Second, the turn player receives Opportunity. This point at which players are granted Opportunity during this part of the phase is considered “before end of turn” and is the only time players may act before this phase and turn progress to their conclusion. 

3. Third, after all effects are resolved and all players have passed on Opportunity in succession, the game immediately proceeds through a series of the following special game actions. 

Temporary damage marked on allies is removed. 

Any “until the end of the turn,” “this turn” or other \(similar effects \(EOT\)/one-shot effects\) end, and any effects that happen “as turns end” or “as your turn ends” \(or other variations\) occur. 

If any hand-size or memory-size limits are imposed, the turn player must discard cards from either of the zones until the limit is not exceeded. 

State-based actions are checked.

**Turn Order - Combat Phase**

The combat phase has the following sections:

• Attacking and the Combat Phase

• Attack Declarations

• Retaliation Step

• Damage Step

82

18/06/2025, 20:36

Grand Archive Comprehensive Rules v1.1.1

**Combat Phase - Attacking**

**and the Combat Phase**

1. An attack is an event that may be initiated by a player through an ally object or a champion object to an attackable unit or object. 

a. All units may attack the turn they enter the field as long as they are awake b. Attacks are declared as a slow player action during a player’s main phase. 

c. Attacks can’t be performed by units without a power stat or with 0 or less power. 

d. Attacking will rest the attacking unit as a cost to declaring an attack or activating an attack card. 

e. If there are any additional costs imposed for declaring attacks, they must be paid as attacks are being declared. If they can’t be paid, the attack can’t be declared. 

f. Attacking is a player action that begins a Combat phase. 

g. Only one combat phase will be initiated per attack declaration and only one combat phase may resolve at a time. No player receives Opportunity during attack declarations. 

i. If an attack card resolves during combat and a new attack declaration is attempted, it will fizzle and combat will continue as normal. 

2. Attacking has steps involving attack activation \(if it is an attack card\), declaration of the attack, and initiation of a Combat phase involving a Retaliation step, then a Damage step. 

a. Attack cards can still be activated without a legal target in play, however, the attack will immediately fizzle when a target declaration can’t occur. 

b. Attack declarations from allies and champions must specify the attack target during declaration. If there is no valid target, the attack cannot be declared. 

3. Target declarations of attacks using attack cards are declared after the attack cards resolve and enter a champion’s intent zone. There is no window between an attack card resolving and entering the intent zone in which a player is given Opportunity. 

4. After an attack declaration, objects and players involved in the initiated combat phase assume certain roles: The player controlling the attacked objects is designated the defending player; the player controlling the attacking units is designated the attacking player. The unit attacking immediately is designated an attacking unit and gains the 

"attacking" property. Similarly, the target/targets of the attack also becomes/become the defending object and gain the "defending" property. The role of attacking and 83

18/06/2025, 20:36

Grand Archive Comprehensive Rules v1.1.1

defending players remains defined until the end of the combat phase, regardless of whether any objects are currently attacking or defending. 

a. If a defending object becomes an illegal or invalid target for an ongoing attack, the defending object immediately stops being a defending object as a result of state-based effects. 

b. If an attacking unit has no valid or legal attack targets at any point in combat, it immediately stops being an attacking unit as a result of state-based effects. 

5. Attacks performed through a champion may be performed through the use of a weapon, through activating an attack card, attacking normally if the champion has a power stat greater than 0, or any combination of these simultaneously. 

a. Attacks performed with a weapon may be performed in the main phase using slow timing conventions. 

b. If a player attacks through their champion using an attack card, the player must announce whether or not they will use a weapon during the attack declaration \(after the attack card has resolved and enters the intent zone\). 

c. The power stat of the champion \(if the champion has a power stat\) and all of the cards, objects, and effects involved in the attack as well as damage-altering effects are combined only during the damage step. Cards and objects used in an attack can include any cards in the intent zone, weapons used during the attack, or any other cards specified during attack declarations. All cards and objects involved in an attack will contribute their power during damage calculation, regardless of card typing. 

d. If a weapon leaves the field before damage is dealt by a champion, any damage that would be dealt due to the weapon will not be calculated during the damage step of the combat phase. If the weapon is type-changed during an attack it was used, it will still be considered as a card involved in the attack and will still contribute its power in the damage calculation if it still has a power stat. 

6. After an attack card resolves, it enters the intent where the attack is reflected and modifiers may affect it. 

a. To represent a resolved attack card, players should place the card somewhere in the play area visible to all players and this will be considered a part of the intent until the end of combat. 

b. While in the intent until the Damage Step, the attack is subject to any effects that may modify that attack. 

7. If an attacking unit were to leave the field before the damage step, that unit would never deal the damage it would have dealt. 

84

18/06/2025, 20:36

Grand Archive Comprehensive Rules v1.1.1

8. If an object being attacked were to leave the field before the damage step, that object would never be dealt the damage it would have been dealt. 

9. An attacking unit will cease being an attacker after losing each of its attack targets. 

10. Players can’t target units they control with attacks. 

85

18/06/2025, 20:36

Grand Archive Comprehensive Rules v1.1.1

**Combat Phase - Attack Declaration**

1. First, a player declares an attack. After an attack declaration, the turn immediately enters the combat phase. 

2. Attack declarations cannot be responded to and no player receives Opportunity as a result of an attack declaration. 

3. Attack cards must first resolve and enter a champion’s intent before attack declarations can be made and combat can begin. 

4. After an attack is declared, any On Attack triggers are placed onto the Effects Stack and players will be able to respond at the beginning of the Retaliation Step of combat. 

5. Combat will not end as a result of either all defending or all attacking units leaving the field during combat; the combat phase will still proceed through all combat steps and sub-phases. 

86

18/06/2025, 20:36

Grand Archive Comprehensive Rules v1.1.1

**Combat Phase - Retaliation Step**

1. First, if any abilities or effects were placed onto the Effects Stack during or after attack declarations, players will receive Opportunity in turn order to respond to these effects. 

After the Effects Stack is empty, the game will proceed to step 2. 

2. Second, turn player receives opportunity. This point at which players are granted Opportunity during this phase is considered “before retaliation” and is the only time players may act before the game progresses until the damage step is entered. 

3. Third, if there are any awake defending units, for each of those units, its controlling player may choose to rest that unit to retaliate against the attacking unit. 

a. If they do so, the unit being retaliated becomes the target of retaliation of the retaliating unit and the retaliating unit will deal damage according to its power stat to its retaliation target during the Damage Step. 

4. Then, after the Effects Stack is empty, and each player has passed on Opportunity in succession, the game immediately proceeds to the Damage Step of combat. 

Units without a power stat or with a power stat of 0 or less cannot retaliate. Weapons can’t be used to retaliate or during retaliation. 

87

18/06/2025, 20:36

Grand Archive Comprehensive Rules v1.1.1

**Combat Phase - Damage Step**

1. First, the turn player receives opportunity. This point at which players are granted Opportunity during this phase is considered “before damage” and is the only time players may act before the game progresses until the conclusion combat phase. 

2. Second, if there are multiple units retaliating against the attacker, the attacking player chooses the order in which the retaliating units will deal damage to the attacking unit. 

Damage will be done simultaneously, however the order determines how damage will interact with any replacement effects such as damage prevention and for On Hit and On Kill triggers. 

a. For each attacker, the only On Kill abilities from a retaliating source that will trigger are those from the damage source marking lethal damage and that would send the attacking unit to the graveyard as a result of combat damage 3. Third, after the Effects Stack is empty, and each player has passed on Opportunity in succession, damage is dealt simultaneously between the attacking unit and its target, and, if any, the retaliating unit\(s\) to its/their retaliation targets. 

a. Damage calculation from the attacker first involves summation of power stats of all Intents \(all cards in the intent\), weapons used by the attacker, and any additive or subtractive power modifiers. Any replacement effects or further modifiers are applied after this. 

b. If a retaliating unit were to leave the field before the damage step, it would deal no damage and be dealt no damage. 

c. A retaliating unit will still deal damage to its retaliation target even if the attacking unit is no longer considered to be attacking. 

d. Damage dealt by a retaliating unit is considered combat damage. 

e. If any weapon or attack card effects would modify the damage dealt by an attack or create additional effects, those effects are applied after the combining of power stats during the dealing of damage within the damage step. Damage is all applied in one instance. 

f. If any replacement effects with damage occur, the controller of the object taking damage chooses the order in which they apply sequentially and step-wise for each replacement effect. 

g. Combat damage and removal of durability counters for weapons involved in attacks are done simultaneously. 

88

18/06/2025, 20:36

Grand Archive Comprehensive Rules v1.1.1

i. Damage dependent upon the number of durability counters on a weapon is taken before any durability counters are removed. 

ii. If a weapon is used in an attack and was part of dealing damage or dealt damage, a durability counter is removed in this phase. Durability is still removed if the damage dealt is 0. No durability counters are removed if the attack was negated or fizzled, the defending object left the field or became an illegal attack target before damage was dealt, or if the weapon left the field before damage was dealt. 

h. In the time that an instance of damage is being dealt, no Opportunity is given; no actions may be taken by players during this game state. 

4. Finally, after damage is calculated correctly and dealt, the game progresses to the End of Combat step. 

Regarding retaliation damage: If a retaliating unit was given stealth at the beginning of the damage step, a targeted attack without True Sight will become illegal and the unit retaliating won’t be dealt damage, however, the retaliating unit will still deal damage to the unit declared attacking. 

Regarding damage prevention: A player controlling an effect that prevents 1 damage from a source has a champion being attacked by another player’s champion using Rending Flames as well as an effect that increases damage dealt by 1. The defending player may order the effects such that: Damage is decreased by 1, then doubled, and then increased by 1 to minimize damage dealt. 

89

18/06/2025, 20:36

Grand Archive Comprehensive Rules v1.1.1

**Combat Phase - End of Combat Step**

The end of combat step will always happen regardless if an attack has dealt damage; if a combat phase was initiated, there will be an end of combat step. In this step, the game will proceed through a series of turn-based actions which comprise the end of combat. 

1. Any cards in the intent are placed into the graveyard. 

2. Attacking and defending objects are removed from combat \(they stop being attacking and defending units\). 

3. State-based effects are checked. 

4. After the Effects Stack is empty and all players have passed any Opportunity they may have received in succession, the game will return the turn player to the main phase. 

If any abilities are triggered during the damage step, they will be placed onto the Effects Stack during this phase. 

90

18/06/2025, 20:36

Grand Archive Comprehensive Rules v1.1.1

**Turn Order - Ending Phases**

If an effect or condition ends a phase of the game, all effects in the Effects Stack will not resolve and all cards in the Effects Stack will be banished. 

1. If there are any sub-phases or steps associated with the phase other than the ending of a phase, those will be skipped and the game will immediately proceed to the end of the phase. 

2. If the combat phase is ended, the game will proceed to the end of the combat step and then immediately proceed to the main phase. 

If an effect or condition ends the turn, all effects in the Effects Stack will not resolve and all cards in the Effects Stack will be banished. The game will immediately proceed to End Phase Step 4, the final part of the End Phase, complete any associated game actions, and then directly proceed to the following turn. 

3. The card or ability that ended the phase will not be banished itself; it will \(by default\) go to the graveyard as it resolves before the phase is ended. 

91

18/06/2025, 20:36

Grand Archive Comprehensive Rules v1.1.1

**Turn Order - Skipping Phases**

If an effect or condition would skip a phase in the game, that phase does not happen. No turn-based actions or effects would take place that are tied to that phase and a player would never receive Opportunity to take player actions during that phase if they would be granted Opportunity during that phase. 

Phases can be skipped multiple times. If this occurs, those phases will be individually skipped, even across multiple turns, if necessary. 

The skipped phase will not proceed through any end-of-phase effects or turn-based actions. 

E.g. If a player’s End Phase were skipped, nothing that would take place during the End Phase \(such as end of turn effects\) would take place. If a pending trigger specified “the next end phase,” it would happen during the next player’s End Phase. If a pending trigger instead said 

“your next end phase,” it would happen during your next turn’s end phase. 

92

18/06/2025, 20:36

Grand Archive Comprehensive Rules v1.1.1

**Game Mechanics - Playing Cards**

Activating or materializing a card counts as playing that card. 

Only a card’s owner can play that card. 

If an attempted play is illegal, that play is canceled and the game state will revert to the point before the play was initiated. 

All cards in the Effects Stack are controlled by the player who played them. 

The following pages discuss these topics:

• Card Activation

• Card Materialization

• Costs and Memory

• Resolution

93

18/06/2025, 20:36

Grand Archive Comprehensive Rules v1.1.1

**Playing Cards - Card Activation**

In activating a card, a player takes the card from the zone it currently is in, puts it onto the Effects Stack, and pays its associated activation costs. Activating a card has the following steps in order: Announcing the Activation, Checking Elements, Declaring Costs, Selecting Modes, Declaring Targets, Checking Legality, Calculating Reserve Cost, Paying Costs, and Activation. 

1. **Announcing Activation**: First, the player announces the card they are activating and places it onto the effects stack. 

2. **Checking Elements**: Then, the game checks whether the player has the required elements enabled to activate the card. If not, the activation is illegal. 

3. **Declaring Costs**: Next, the player declares the intended cost parameters for the card. 

a. If a card has X in its cost, the player must declare the value of X. 

b. If the card has optional costs, the player must declare all additional costs that they will pay. 

c. If the card has an alternative cost, they must declare if they are paying the alternative cost. If there are multiple alternative costs, the player can choose which alternative cost they will choose among them. 

d. If a card uses the phrasing “Up to \[X\] target \[object\(s\)\], these must be specified during target selection. 

Innervate Fury cannot choose 8 allies to split damage among and select one of the target allies to receive 0 damage. This means, effectively, there can be at most 7 targets to split damage between. 

94



18/06/2025, 20:36

Grand Archive Comprehensive Rules v1.1.1

4. **Selecting Modes: **Some cards require that one or more modes are selected out of given options when activating the card and placing it onto the effects stack. All modes must be selected as the card is placed onto the effects stack and the selected modes may not be changed after the card is activated. 

a. If any modes are selected based on unlocked class bonuses at the time of the activation, these modes will still be selected and remain unchanged unless the class bonus is lost. They will not be regained statically if class bonus is lost. 

5. **Declaring Targets**: After modes are selected, any necessary targets for successful activation must be chosen. A target may only be selected if it is legal. If an effect instructs a player to choose "up to" or "any number" or "any amount" or any variation of this, these targets are optional; they are not required for successful activation of the card. 

6. **Checking Legality**: Then, the game performs a legality check for card activation and, if any part of the activation is not legal, the activation is canceled, and the game will revert to the point before the card activation was declared. No action will be considered to have been taken nor will event triggers be generated. 

7. **Calculating Reserve Cost**: Next, the player calculates the reserve cost of the card with the following steps:

a. First, the starting reserve cost of the card is determined. 

95

18/06/2025, 20:36

Grand Archive Comprehensive Rules v1.1.1

b. Second, effects that set a reserve cost are applied. 

c. Third, effects that add or subtract to or from the reserve cost are applied simultaneously. 

d. Fourth, effects that remove reserve costs are applied. This would cause reserve cost to become 0. Effects can’t cause the reserve cost to be less than 0. 

8. **Paying Costs**: Next, the player pays the reserve cost and any additional or alternative costs of the card. If the costs cannot be paid, then the activation is illegal and the game state is reversed before activation was initiated. Costs can be paid in any order so long as they are fulfilled. 

a. Costs may be paid through replacement effects. 

b. If the payment of costs results in any modifications or additional modes being added to an activation, step 4 will be repeated for any new unselected modes or options. The same will be true for step 5 and 6, however, step 7 will not be repeated. 

Previously chosen targets and modes that were not modified or added in this step cannot be changed. 

E.g. For 8.a, Cordelia gives your tokens Reservable. You would be able to rest four Powercell tokens to pay for the reserve cost of Overlord before sacrificing the Powercells for the additional cost. 

96





18/06/2025, 20:36

Grand Archive Comprehensive Rules v1.1.1



9. **Activation**: Then, the card is considered activated, and the player who activated the card gains opportunity. 

97

18/06/2025, 20:36

Grand Archive Comprehensive Rules v1.1.1

Cards can only be activated from hand unless otherwise stated. 

Cards that enter the Effects Stack as a result of that card having been activated will cause that card to be considered an activation while it is in the Effects Stack. 

Some effects will specify that you may activate a card with a memory cost as opposed to materializing it. 

Activating a card will still follow the aforementioned method of paying for memory costs as well as placing the card into the Effects Stack to resolve. 

Activating a card is not dependent upon whether a player has or has not materialized for this turn; players may still activate cards with memory costs if that player has materialized a card and vice versa. 

98

18/06/2025, 20:36

Grand Archive Comprehensive Rules v1.1.1

**Playing Cards - Card Materialization**

In materializing a card, a player takes the card from the zone it currently is in, puts it onto the Effects Stack, and pays its associated materialization costs. Materializing a card has the following steps in order: Announcing the Materialization, Checking Elements, Declaring Costs, Selecting Modes, Declaring Targets, Checking Legality, Calculating Memory Costs, Paying Costs, and Materialization. 

A player may only materialize a card once per materialize phase or if an effect gives a player permission to materialize a card. 

Materializing a card follows the same initial steps as listed in Card Activation Steps 1 

through 5, with the exception that the card is announced for materialization rather than activation. 

6. **Checking Legality**: The game performs a legality check for card materialization and, if any part of the materialization is not legal, the materialization is canceled, and the game will revert to the point before the card materialization was declared. No action will be considered to have been taken nor will event triggers generated. This part is distinguished from the step for activation as, specifically, for playing Champions, players must meet the requirements to play the champion intended for materialization, including any Lineage or leveling requirements. 

7. **Calculating Memory Cost**: Next, the player calculates the memory cost of the card with the following steps:

a. First, the starting memory cost of the card is determined. 

b. Second, effects that set a memory cost are applied. 

c. Third, effects that add or subtract to or from the memory cost are applied simultaneously. 

d. Fourth, effects that remove memory costs are applied. This would cause reserve cost to become 0. Effects can’t cause the memory cost to be less than 0. 

8. **Paying Costs**: Next, the player pays the memory cost and any additional or alternative costs of the card. If the costs cannot be paid, then the materialization is illegal and the game state is reversed before materialization was initiated. 

a. Costs may be paid through replacement effects.

9. **Materialization**: Then, the card is considered materialized, and the player who materialized the card gains opportunity. 

Cards that enter the Effects Stack as a result of that card having been materialized will cause that card to be considered a materialization while it is in the Effects Stack. 

Cards without Memory Costs cannot be materialized.

**Playing Cards - Costs and Memory**

Reserve costs are paid by reserving cards into the memory zone from the hand. 

1. Cards selected for reserve costs may only be changed up until the player confirms the selection and places the activated card onto the Effects Stack. 

2. Players may not exchange reserved cards once this has been done and may not interchange already reserved cards while activating another card. 

3. Players must clearly represent chosen and reserved cards. 

4. Cards placed into memory for reserve costs remain there even if the card or effect does not resolve. 

5. Materialization can involve cards with reserve costs. In this case, reserve costs are paid rather than memory costs. 

Memory costs require banishing cards from cards in the memory zone at random. 

6. Cards selected for memory costs are chosen randomly by a fair selection process \(a process that provides equal probabilities for any one card to be selected\). 

7. Once cards have been selected for memory costs \(including cards with floating memory chosen for payment\), no cards may be interchanged or reselected and the chosen cards are then banished simultaneously. 

8. The card is then immediately placed into the Effects Stack for resolution. 

Cards without specified reserve costs can’t be paid for by reserving 0 cards; cards without memory costs can’t be paid for by paying a memory cost of 0. Not having a cost is not the same as having a cost of 0 in each of these respects; players can’t pay null/non-existent costs. 

See floating memory for additional information on cost payment methods.

Grand Archive Comprehensive Rules v1.1.1

**Playing Cards - Resolution**

Resolution of cards or abilities happens after all costs for playing the card are paid, the card is played, passes legality checks, is placed into the Effects Stack, and no player has taken any player actions or the game state has not changed in a way that would invalidate the card or ability. A card is then resolved when the above conditions are met and while no other game actions are taking place; cards are resolved at discrete points of time within a game, with each card/ability having its own point in time to resolve. 

Resolving a card involves performing the actions and applying the effects listed on a card or ability is resolved step-wise, starting from the top of its rules text to the bottom. State-based effects are not checked unless explicitly required by the card. Only after the rules text is resolved will the next state-based check occur. 

E.g. If an effect says “Glimpse 2. Draw a card,” the player must first Glimpse 2, only after which they can draw a card. No state-based checks occur between each instruction. 

1. All champions, allies, weapons, items, domains, tokens, and other objects will enter the field or intent under the control of the player who controlled the corresponding card or effect that would generate the object in the Effects Stack 2. “You” printed on a card or implicit in commands are directed to the controller, while other specified players or objects are referenced according to target declarations on activation/materialization. 

3. All action cards will resolve from the perspective of the player who controlled the corresponding card in the Effects Stack. 

4. All effects will resolve from the perspective of the player who controlled the effect in the Effects Stack. 

5. Some effects specify "may" as a permission-based clause during the resolution of an effect or ability. For these effects, the specified player will choose to accept or reject the option offered during the resolution. There is no later point in time at which this decision can be made. 

6. As attack cards resolve, the game will check if it is legal for its controller to initiate a combat phase. If it is, the attack card will resolve and enter a player’s champion’s intent from the perspective of the player that controlled the corresponding card in the Effects 102

18/06/2025, 20:36

Grand Archive Comprehensive Rules v1.1.1

Stack. If a combat phase cannot be initiated \(e.g., an attack card was activated at fast speed during the opponent’s turn\), the attack fizzles as a state-based action. 

7. If any optional choices are made for any effects during a resolution, such as "you may X" 

where X is a requirement, cost, or action, the player must completely do X for any related effects to happen; players can't partially fulfill the condition on optional effects. 

Typically, these effects are tied to a default case of "if you don't," which will automatically be applied if the optional cost/action is not taken. 

**Checking Resolution**

Before a card or ability begins resolving, the game will perform a check to make sure that all conditions for successful resolution are met. 

1. For champions, a level-check and lineage check will be performed in addition to any other legality checks upon attempted resolution of a champion materialization. 

2. If the resolution is deemed illegal in any way, it will instead “fizzle”; if something fizzles any of the effects that would occur during its resolution don't, and it would not become an object, if it were to do so. 

3. The phrasing “Up to \[X\] target \[object\]” on cards and effects is treated as optional conditions and will not impact whether or not a card will resolve correctly. The same is true for wording such as "any number" or "any amount" for chosen targets. 

4. Cards and effects that specify and quantify the necessary targets that must be chosen on the declaration of activation or playing of the card must have each of its targets still be valid/legal upon resolution. 

a. A card or effect \(such as abilities or attacks\) resolves if and only if the targets selected are all still legal targets for the event upon resolution \(apart from “Up to 

\[X\]” target phrasings\). 

b. If any one of the necessary targets becomes illegal/invalid at the point of resolution, the entire card/effect does not resolve. If a card does not resolve this way, the card is then sent to the graveyard \(or if it is regalia, to banishment\). 

103

18/06/2025, 20:36

Grand Archive Comprehensive Rules v1.1.1

**Game Mechanics - Abilities**

Abilities are characteristics of cards and objects that affect the game and either produce an instanced effect or a continuous effect for a specified duration \(E.g. “until end of turn.”\) Abilities can be either Activated abilities, Triggered abilities, or Static abilities, and some abilities \(or functional rules\) can be bound by Restriction abilities. 

1. Abilities intrinsic to the card are considered characteristics of the card and apply globally inside and outside of the game in all zones. 

a. Keywords are an example of an intrinsic card characteristic b. If the keyword is tied to a restriction, if an effect asks the game to check for the keyword, it will do so during resolution to determine the effect or action legality. 

Failing the check would cause the game to act as if the checked characteristic is absent. 

Abilities tied to objects generally only function from the field, however, cards may specify zones in which that ability functions. 

2. Abilities specifying a zone or zones in which they function may not function in any other zones. 

3. Abilities specifying a zone or zones in which they do not function may function in other zones. 

Abilities of action cards generally only function in the Effects Stacks. 

Abilities of attack cards generally only function while they are in the intent. 

Abilities of non-action, non-attack cards generally only function while they exist on the field as objects. 

Abilities can specify zones from where an effect may take place or from where that ability may be activated that are not their default functional zone \(Effects Stack for action cards, the field for non-action card objects\). 

Multiple non-keyword abilities on a card or object are separated by paragraph breaks. 

104

18/06/2025, 20:36

Grand Archive Comprehensive Rules v1.1.1

Some abilities can be granted temporarily or permanently to cards, objects, or players, by other effects or abilities. 

Multiple instances of the same ability stack only if that ability is not classified as redundant. 

4. Redundant abilities and keywords of an object will only take effect once regardless of the multiplicity of instances in which that ability or keyword is active. 

5. Redundant abilities and keywords will only consider the first instance of that ability or keyword for counting purposes. 

E.g. If an ally has three instances of vigor, other cards and effects would see that ally as having only one ability.  Keywords contains information on ability redundancy. 

Abilities consider the source of the ability as the object or card that generated the ability and are controlled by the player who controlled that object or card that generated the ability, whether triggered or activated. If any ability refers to its source’s characteristics, the last known information regarding the source is used. 

E.g. If an ally with an On Death trigger has an effect based upon that ally’s power, the power considered will be that of the ally while it was on the field before it died. 

6. An ability placed in the Effects Stack exists independently of its source and will not be negated or fizzled if its source ceases to exist or is itself negated. If the source of the ability has left the zone it was in or changed control, the last known information under its controller at that time is used. 

7. All abilities in the Effects Stack are controlled by the player who controlled the source generating that ability. 

8. Face-down cards or cards in any non-public zones will have all abilities, intrinsic or otherwise, concealed from each player. They are considered as just cards without any other characteristics until they are revealed or their characteristics are checked in some manner. 

The following pages discuss these topics:

• Activated Abilities

**Abilities - Activated Abilities**

Activation of abilities uses a process similar to card activations: To activate an ability, a player must:

• Announce the ability they wish to activate, 

• Select its modes and targets, 

• And pay the associated costs of that ability \(reserve and other costs\). 

The ability is considered activated when all steps listed above have been completed. 

After costs have been paid, the ability then goes to the Effects Stack for resolution, and Opportunity is then first given to the turn player to respond. 

If there are no legal modes that can be chosen, the ability can’t be activated, following standard activation rules. 

A player may only activate an ability when they have Opportunity and may legally do so according to timing conventions. 

Activated abilities are worded as \[Cost\] : \[Effect\]. Any restrictions are specified after effects. 

Activated abilities use fast speed by default. 

Activated abilities can’t retroactively affect costs for activations in the Effects Stack nor any modes chosen for the activation. 

Activated abilities of attack cards can only be used from the intent by default. 

107

18/06/2025, 20:36

Grand Archive Comprehensive Rules v1.1.1

**Abilities - Triggered Abilities**

Triggered abilities are abilities placed into the Effects Stack by a player during state-based checks due to fulfillment of a game event or condition \(i.e., the “trigger”\). Resolution of triggered abilities will cause the effect specified after the trigger to take effect. Triggered abilities whose effects use the word “may” are an exception to this; the player who controls the trigger is often given a choice as to which effect, if any, were to happen during resolution. 

Trigger abilities generally use the words “At,” “When,” or “Whenever,” to specify a triggering event, followed by \(optionally\) an intervening condition or “if” statement, and ultimately an effect. Triggered abilities can be keyworded where the conditions and triggering events are shortened within the keyword, but will typically be absent of any intervening conditions. As such, keyworded triggered abilities will trigger as long as the keyword-bound condition is met, regardless of any further specified conditions listed in the effect\(s\) of the ability. 

1. Triggered abilities are generally worded as “\[Trigger\], \[Condition\], \[Effect\]. A \[Condition\] 

can further modify the main trigger and typically uses words such as “If” or “Unless.” For non-keyworded triggered abilities, the ability will fail to trigger if this condition is not satisfied in addition to the triggering event; it will never be placed onto the effects stack to pend resolution. Additionally, if such a condition was specified and fulfilled such that the trigger entered the Effects Stack, the trigger will not resolve if the condition is unmet during resolution. 

2. Some triggered abilities are conditionally triggered abilities which will describe a condition that must be satisfied followed by the effect which will be placed onto the Effects Stack when the trigger condition is met. Conditionally triggered abilities typically use keywords such as On Enter and are worded as “\[Trigger/Trigger Condition\] 

: \[Effect\]”. These conditions will typically be present for common events or uncomplicated conditions, such as On Enter, On Attack, or On Death. 

E.g., Lorraine, Wandering Warrior has “On Enter: Materialize a weapon card with memory cost 0 from your material deck.” The “On Enter” is a conditionally triggered ability that will place the effect of “Materialize a weapon card with memory cost 0 from your material deck” onto the Effects Stack when the trigger condition is met. 

108



18/06/2025, 20:36

Grand Archive Comprehensive Rules v1.1.1

3. For each case, the trigger or trigger condition must be fulfilled for the trigger to enter the Effects Stack. 

These abilities follow the resolution conventions the same way activated abilities do after they are placed into the Effects Stack. 

If a triggered ability asks that a player choose a mode, that mode is chosen as the ability enters the Effects Stack and can’t be changed while it is there. If there are no legal modes that can be chosen, the ability will fizzle. Similarly, if a triggered ability requires a target, that target must be selected as it is placed onto the effects stack. If no legal targets are available, the ability will fizzle. 

Some triggered abilities are delayed trigger abilities, which can generate delayed triggers that cause the ability to enter the Effects Stack at a later time, such as at the end of a turn. 

They may also use words such as “At” or “When,” but may not necessarily start with those words. 

4. Delayed triggers are generated as a result of the resolution of another ability. If the original ability that would generate the delayed trigger is negated or fizzles, the delayed trigger will not be generated. 

109

18/06/2025, 20:36

Grand Archive Comprehensive Rules v1.1.1

5. Delayed triggers only happen once, like normal triggered abilities. If the trigger fails at the next possible opportunity, it will not generate another delayed trigger to attempt resolving again. 

6. Delayed triggered abilities are still considered abilities and may be negated or fizzled. 

When multiple triggered abilities enter the Effects Stack simultaneously, they will be stacked in turn order starting with the abilities that belong to the turn player. Each player will be able to select which order their own abilities will enter the Effects Stack when it is their turn to place their abilities into the Effects Stack. Only after each triggered ability is placed into the Effects Stack this way will the turn player be granted Opportunity and the triggered abilities will have a chance to resolve after the sequential passing of Opportunity. 

If a trigger is generated while another effect or activation is resolving, the trigger will be placed onto the Effects Stack only after that effect/activation is completely resolved. If a card generates its own trigger as it resolves or while it is resolving due to a condition, this is known as a reflexive trigger. 

Triggered abilities will have the same typing, element, and other relevant characteristics as their source. 

110



18/06/2025, 20:36

Grand Archive Comprehensive Rules v1.1.1



The triggers sourced from Stratagem of Myriad Ice are also considered of the Water element and of a Mage Spell typing. These triggers will not be able to target any objects with Spellshroud. 

111

18/06/2025, 20:36

Grand Archive Comprehensive Rules v1.1.1

**Abilities - Static Abilities**

1. Static abilities do not use the Effects Stack and instead are always passively and persistently enabled, affecting the game state continuously. 

2. An ability is static if it does not have a point at which it ends or would be specified to end. 

3. Static abilities generally create continuous effects. 

4. Cost-modifying static abilities will not change the cost of the card as printed in any zone; they will only modify the payment for that cost. 

E.g. A card with a reserve cost of 7 and Efficiency with the champion’s level equal to 3 will require that the player pay 4 reserve for activating the card, however, if a card were to negate the activation of cards with reserve cost of 6 or higher, the card would still be negated. 

112

18/06/2025, 20:36

Grand Archive Comprehensive Rules v1.1.1

**Abilities - Restriction Abilities**

Restrictions grant additional abilities or functional rules text for a card or object based on whether or not a specified condition is fulfilled. These restrictions will typically be represented as a restriction bubble or a level threshold bolded on the card. Examples of restriction bubbles are Class Bonus and Element Bonus while a level restriction will show as a bolded level threshold. 

Multiple conditions can restrict the same ability or card text. In this case, each restriction condition must be fulfilled for the ability or rules text to be active. If any of the restrictions preceding an ability on a card are not met, the associated effect rules text is ignored in all zones. If any intrinsic properties would be granted to a card based on the restriction conditions, none of those properties would be granted if the conditions are not met. 

If a restriction or combined restrictions are not met, any abilities or rules text associated with that level restriction is ignored in all zones. Restrictions will not follow any of their associated abilities to the Effects Stack after an ability has been put onto the Effects Stack. 

**Types of Restrictions**

Restriction abilities fall under two categories: Static versus In-line restrictions. 

Static restrictions appear as black bubbles with white text detailing the restriction ability. 

These restrictions will statically lock any modes or abilities listed after it for as long as the condition is not met. When activating cards and abilities, the modes and targets of card or ability activated will enter the Effects Stack depending on the condition of the restriction ability during activation. Any changes in available targeting or mode selection will not change for that spell or ability regardless if the state of the restriction ability \(on/off\) changes. 

1. Restriction abilities that precede effects that specify selection of a necessary target or a mode will not fizzle as a result of losing the condition to fulfill the restriction ability if it was previously unlocked. 

In-line restrictions appear as **bolded** black text next to effects on a card or ability. These restrictions typically do not depend on activation timings, necessary \(non-optional\) target selections, or mode selections. These restriction abilities will function during the resolution 113

18/06/2025, 20:36

Grand Archive Comprehensive Rules v1.1.1

of the card or ability rather than during activation and the process of card or ability activation. 

List of Restriction Abilities:

**Level Restrictions**

A card or ability might specify that an effect can only to happen if the level of a champion is sufficient to match the restriction. This considers any positive or negative level modifications for calculating the level for the requirement and not just the level printed on the champion card in play. 

E.g., a restriction of 2\+ required the champion’s LV to be 2 or higher. 

**Class Restrictions**

A card or ability might specify that an effect can only to happen if one or more classes of a champion matches the the one or more classes on the card which is the source of the ability. 

**Memory Restrictions**

A card or ability might specify that an effect can only happen if there are the required number of cards in that player's memory. 

**Element Restrictions**

A card or ability might specify that an effect can only happen if the element of the ability's source matches at least one of the elements of the ability's controller's champion. 

**Champion Restrictions**

A card or ability might specify that an effect can only happen if the champion's name \(excluding title\) matches the name specified by the champion restriction ability.

18/06/2025, 20:36

Grand Archive Comprehensive Rules v1.1.1

**Abilities - Ability Tracking**

Some abilities ask players to remember previously selected modes or options for abilities. 

Abilities tracked in this way depend on the card that creates and instances the ability. 

For champions, this means that the champion card which creates the corresponding ability will track the selected options, not the champion object. This is analogous to an object leaving and re-entering the field with a new instance of that object being created, along with its abilities. 

E.g. Tonoris, Genesis Aegis says “At the beginning of your recollection phase, choose one that hasn’t been chosen —” followed by a list of options for summoning tokens. If this Tonoris were to be deleted into a level 2 champion and then the player levels back into Tonoris, Genesis Aegis, a new “version” of the champion card is seen as entering play and will re-instance the triggered ability without any memory of which options were previously chosen. This means a re-leveled champion will be able to select “previously selected” options.

**Game Mechanics - Types of Effects**

The following pages discuss these topics:

• Game Effects

• Replacement Effects

• Continuous Effects

117

18/06/2025, 20:36

Grand Archive Comprehensive Rules v1.1.1

**Types of Effects - Game Effects**

Game effects are those that only impact the game as a result of the game mechanics taking effect to resolve a game state and to move the game to a state where players can again act. 

Game effects include:

• Temporary effects ending \(apart from those ending during the end phase\)

• A weapon being destroyed or banished as a result of having 0 durability during the damage step of attacks

• Allies being destroyed by having marked damage equal to or greater than the life stat of the ally card

• Players losing the game as a result of having marked damage on their champion equal to or greater than the life state of the champion

• Players losing the game as a result of attempting to draw from an empty deck \(“decking out”\)

• Tokens ceasing to exist if they are existing in a zone other than the field during game state checks

• Players being required to sacrifice copies of a controlled Unique object Game effects often rely on the state of the game to determining what events occur. 

The game will check the game state when a player receives Opportunity or as phases begin and end. State-based effects/actions will take place during this time No players receive Opportunity nor may take player actions when game effects are taking place. 

If static effects in the game set contradicting rules within the game or are persistent or continuous effects, these effects use the most recently generated effect modifying those rules. 

E.g., if a player has permanently enabled the fire element, and another player has permanently disabled the fire element afterward, the element is considered disabled. 

118

18/06/2025, 20:36

Grand Archive Comprehensive Rules v1.1.1

If, after this, the original player re-enables the fire element permanently they have that element considered permanently enabled. 

The same rules are applied for the duration of the temporary effects. 

For all such contradicting effects, “can” does not overwrite “can’t” even if the permission-granting effect is more recent. 

Effects dependent on the destruction of an object do not produce effects if the object is instead put into Banishment. 

Effects that would copy cards or objects copy all characteristics of those cards or objects at the time that effect resolves. 

119

18/06/2025, 20:36

Grand Archive Comprehensive Rules v1.1.1

**Types of Effects - Replacement Effects**

Replacement effects are effects that will cause a specified effect or outcome to occur instead of another or that override the default effects or outcomes as described in the game rules. 

Replacement effects are applied in the order desired by the controlling player whose objects, zones, cards, etc, those replacement effects pertain to. Replacement effects do not function like the Effects Stack which has a first-in-last-out structure. The replacement effect order is determined sequentially in a step-wise fashion. 

When replacement effects are being applied, if multiple effects are replacing or modifying a single type of outcome \(such as damage a unit would receive\), the replacement effects of a given nature will be applied sequentially and determined discretely until there are no further replacement effects to consider. After a replacement effect is applied, only any remaining effects that can apply will be pending replacement. 

Replacement effects typically use phrasing such as “If \[X event\] would occur, \[do Y\]” and commonly use the word “instead.” \(In rare cases, "when" and "whenever" have been used.\) 1. Damage prevention is a common type of replacement effect that will also use the word 

“prevent.” Effects using this word are almost always replacement effects. 

2. Replacement effects may still be generated as a result of a triggered ability. Vice versa, triggered abilities may become triggered as a result of an alternative outcome from the result of a prior replacement effect. 

Replacement effects can also be continuous effects. 

Damage prevention effects are often a type of replacement effect. 

Some cards allow a player to replace a method of playing a card with another effect, such as Preserve which replaces a materialization by returning the Preserved card from the material deck to the hand. Situations in which a card \(face-up or face-down\) can be legally played in the manner being replaced do not require revealing that card. However, certain situations may result in attempting to replace a playing method that is not publicly known, typically caused by cards being set face-down in a zone with private or hidden 120

18/06/2025, 20:36

Grand Archive Comprehensive Rules v1.1.1

characteristics. In those cases, the player replacing the play method with an effect must reveal the intended card and its intended play method before it can be replaced. 

E.g. A player controls a Quicksilver Grail and has banished a non-champion card. That player activates the ability of the Grail and states they wish to return a card Preserved in their Material deck to their hand rather than materializing the card. That player would have to reveal the face-down card and show that it was possible to materialize it. If, on the other hand, the face-down card was a card that could only be activated and not materialized, they would be unable to replace the play method with Preserve’s ability.

**Types of Effects - Continuous Effects**

Continuous effects can be generated due to resolved cards or abilities and can modify properties, stats, or other characteristics of cards, objects, activations, and materialization and can modify or set rules of the game or can affect players for defined or indefinite durations. 

**Instanced Effects**

If the resolution of a card activation, materialization, or ability creates a continuous effect that modifies the characteristics of objects or cards, that effect will only take into consideration the set of objects at the time that effect resolved. These are also known as 

"One-Shot effects." These effects typically use the words "get," "gain," or "become." The set of objects will not change for the duration of that effect; any new objects that enter play after these continuous effects begin will not be affected. 

**Static Effects**

If a continuous effect that modifies or sets rules in a game of Grand Archive is statically applied, the game will apply that effect to all cards within the described set at all times. 

These are known as "Static Effects" and can affect cards, objects, activations, and materializations that were not initially present when the object or card that created the effect first began. These effects can use language such as "get," "have," "are." See here. 

E.g. Inspiring Call specifies that "allies you control **get** \+1 power." Any allies that enter after the fact would not receive the \+1 power as this effect is generated due to Inspiring Call's resolution. On the Other hand, Claude would give all Automaton allies you control the abilities of Taunt and "On Death: Glimpse 3" even if those allies entered play after Claude did, as Claude's effect is Static \(i.e. those Automaton allies have a later timestamp.\) 123





18/06/2025, 20:36

Grand Archive Comprehensive Rules v1.1.1

E.g. Nullifying Lantern will set the element type of all cards in graveyards to Norm regardless of if those cards entered the graveyard after Nullifying Lantern entered play. 

124



18/06/2025, 20:36

Grand Archive Comprehensive Rules v1.1.1

The duration of continuous effects is typically described by the rules text of the card that creates that effect. If no such duration is specified, the continuous effect lasts until the end of the game or until the object source of the ability left the field. The duration of continuous effects may be modified by conditions, typically using the wording “as long as,” which will update the "on-or-off" mode of that ability during State-based checks. 

There is no frame of time in which a player can act where cards, objects, activations, and materializations would not be under modifying continuous effects. 

**Layers**

Several continuous effects can be present during the game. In situations where an effect modifies the same properties of a card, object, or rule attributed to a player, those effects will take precedence based on the timestamp of the effect source \(see 2.4.c.6 below\). 

However, some effects can overlap, altering the same property, such as a card’s element or an ally’s power. Typically, these overlapping effects will be applied according to a 

"Timestamp System." Sometimes, these effects may need information about another continuous effect being applied on the same layer, creating a dependency. Dependencies will override any timestamp-based determination of continuous effects. In these cases, 125

18/06/2025, 20:36

Grand Archive Comprehensive Rules v1.1.1

there exists an order for how to apply these modifications. Layers of continuous effects are checked at the same time as state-based checks in the game. Players receive no Opportunity to act as the game applies the effects through each layer. The order in which layers are applied is as follows:

1. Layer A: Effects/rules setting base values and properties apply. This includes the setting of playing cost values. This includes setting of power, life, durability, levels, playing costs, and default play permissions \(i.e. Fast vs Slow play speed\). 

2. Layer B: Effects/rules that modify a card or object’s types \(i.e. Supertype, Type, or Subtype\) are applied. 

3. Layer C: Effects/rules modifying a card or object’s element are applied. 

4. Layer D: Effects/rules that add or subtract abilities are applied. 

5. Layer E: Effects/rules that increase or decrease power, life, durability, levels, playing costs, or modify play permissions \(i.e. Fast vs Slow play speed\). 

a. Specifically for power and life stats, several effects may modify these values in different ways and require a sub-layering: First, apply any changes from continuous effects that do not set these values. Then, apply any modifications from counters. 

Finally, if any effects may swap power and life, apply these last. 

E.g. Nullifying Lantern and losing abilities — Nullifying Lantern says "Cards in graveyards are norm element.” If another effect causes Nullifying lantern to lose all abilities, Nullifying Lantern’s effect of changing element in the graveyard will still apply. This is because Nullifying Lantern’s effect operates on Layer C while loss of ability operates on Layer D; the effect applies in Layer C before the ability loss is applied in Layer D.

**Timestamps**

127

18/06/2025, 20:36

Grand Archive Comprehensive Rules v1.1.1

Simultaneous continuous effects that modify the same property, characteristic, value, ability, etc. within the same layer are applied according to the “timestamp” established when the effect began. Independent continuous effects within a layer are applied sequentially in order of how recent the timestamp was established, oldest to newest \(first to most recent\). Effects creating dependencies will instead use a different method \(below\). 

1. A timestamp can be tracked as a chronological marker where objects and their effects can be categorized as older or newer relative to when that effect began. For objects that have static abilities that create continuous effects, the timestamp for that effect is tied to when that object entered play. For cards and triggered or activated abilities that produce a continuous effect, the timestamp is tied to when that card or ability is resolved. 

2. If the modified attribute happens in a mutually exclusive fashion, the newest static ability will override the older one. If they are not mutually exclusive, they will both be in effect according to the timestamping of the effects. 

3. For champions, the champion object and cards within the lineage will each follow specific timestamp rules. 

a. The champion object, which is represented by the top-most card in the lineage, has its timestamp set as when the first champion card in that lineage entered the field \(usually this is the Lv 0 Spirit Champion\). 

i. Leveling up so that a new champion card represents the object is not considered a gain of abilities due to continuous effects and will not use Layers. 

That card's rules text is treated as the object's base rules text. 

b. Any cards that enter the lineage will have a timestamp for when that card entered the lineage. This is separate from the timestamp of the champion object and is used to track any abilities or continuous effects from the cards in the lineage. 

**Dependencies**

Some continuous effects may modify characteristics or rules operating on the same layer where those effects are dependent upon the existence or modifications that arise from another effect. A dependent effect is: applied in the same layer as another effect, modified in some way if another effect is applied first \(either by a rules text change, objects to which they apply, or modifies the effect applied to those objects\), and either both or neither set any characteristics \(such as setting playing costs or any stats\). 

128



18/06/2025, 20:36

Grand Archive Comprehensive Rules v1.1.1

If the conditions to establish a dependency are fulfilled, then the timestamp system is disregarded and the dependent effect is applied only after any effects on which it depends are applied first. Timestamp order for dependent effects only applies for simultaneous dependent effects that are independent of each other in the same layer \(i.e. those dependent effects do not depend on each other\) or if those dependent effects form a loop with each other. The order in which effects can apply may change if a pending effect changes it dependency status, either becoming dependent or independent. 

E.g. Mordred effect that gives attack cards in the graveyard Floating Memory depends on Caliburn of Silencing's ability. In this case, Caliburn's effect must be applied first since each ability is applied in Layer D for adding or subtracting abilities.

**Game Mechanics - Objects and Targeting**

Objects are typically things on the field that are interactable which include champion objects, ally objects, weapon objects, item objects, and domain objects, as well as any summoned objects such as tokens on the field. Effects that specify a target <object type> can interact with these objects. 

1. Units are a sub-category of objects which only include allies and champions. These objects are interactable by effects that specify target or chosen ally or champion. 

2. Stats \(e.g. Life, Power, etc\) stay on objects even if they change to an object type that may not necessarily use or interact with that stat. 

Activations are either cards or abilities that have been activated and are in the Effects Stack. Activations are interactable by effects that specify a target or chosen activation. 

Materializations are cards that have been materialized and are in the Effects Stack. 

Materializations are interactable by effects that specify a target or chosen materialization. 

Intents are cards placed in the Intent Zone during combat. Intents are interactable by effects that specify a target or chosen intent. 

Non-objects exist as cards in their respective zones, i.e., a card in the hand, graveyard, deck, memory, banishment, or card-specific zones are treated as cards rather than objects. This is applies to cards within a Lineage \(not the topmost champion card\), Intents, and Loaded Cards. 

A target can specify any of the aforementioned object or card types and an effect can only choose or target cards and/or object of the specified types. If an effect specifies a specific object type as a target, it can only target that object. 

1. If an effect specifies objects by exclusion, it can target any objects that are not excluded. 

E.g., “Target ally” can only target allies. “Target non-champion object” can target any object that is not a champion \(allies, weapons, items, domains, etc.\) 131





18/06/2025, 20:36

Grand Archive Comprehensive Rules v1.1.1

2. If an effect specifies or targets one or more cards in a certain zone, it may only affect cards in that zone. 

132



18/06/2025, 20:36

Grand Archive Comprehensive Rules v1.1.1

3. Tokens of a certain type \(such as ally or regalia\) follow the targeting conventions of those cards. 

E.g. A token ally can be targeted by any effect that can target an ally or a token. 

Special cases with targeting involve an effect specifying that something is chosen rather than targeted. This usually occurs during the resolution of the effects in situations where targets can't be anticipated or specified during the activation process. 

E.g., the card Creative Shock instructs the player to choose a unit and deal 2 damage to it if a Fire card is discarded during the resolution of the spell. This only has a chosen unit after the spell has resolved and can't be specified before as the card to be discarded is yet unknown. 

When effects of cards or abilities use a card type or subtype descriptor and do not refer to a card, activation, materialization, or source, these effects will mean the object with the described type or subtype on the field. 

133

Grand Archive Comprehensive Rules v1.1.1

**Game Mechanics -**

**Timing and Permissions**

**Fast vs Slow **

The timing for playing cards and activating abilities falls under two categories: Slow and Fast timing conventions or speeds. 

Slow speed follows the following conventions:

1. The turn player may play slow action cards \(Action cards with slow speed\), allies, weapons, items, domains, champions, activate slow abilities, and may declare attacks when they have Opportunity and the Effects Stack is empty during their Main Phase. 

These are referred to as “Slow Player Actions.” 

2. The non-turn player can't perform Slow Player Actions. 

Allies and attacks can only be activated at a slow speed. 

Fast speed follows the following conventions:

3. Any player may activate fast cards when they have Opportunity in the turn or no events are otherwise taking place and Opportunity passes as a result of the game state. These are referred to as “Fast Player Actions.” 

4. Activated abilities can be activated at a fast speed. 

**Opportunity**

Opportunity is a concept that governs the activation of cards and abilities at a fast speed. 

1. Opportunity for players arises as a result of a game event taking place which designates a player to receive Opportunity. 

a. Activation of cards or abilities or a triggered ability being placed on the Effects Stack all generate opportunities for players to act upon. 

b. Opportunity will always arise whenever there is an effect pending resolution in the Effects Stack. 

134

18/06/2025, 20:36

Grand Archive Comprehensive Rules v1.1.1

2. While a player has Opportunity, that player may activate any card or activate any ability with a fast speed. If the turn player has Opportunity and it is their main phase, they may perform slow player actions. 

3. Players pass Opportunity in turn order declining to take further player actions. 

4. Players pass Opportunity to the next player in turn order until every player has had a chance to respond to the top effect of the Effects Stack. 

5. The top layer in the Effects Stack resolves after all players in a game have successfully passed on Opportunity for one cycle. 

6. Following this, the taking of player actions and the passing of Opportunity is repeated until all effects, card activations and materializations, and abilities pending resolution have been resolved. 

7. Any time the bottommost layer of the Effects Stack resolves, if the game is currently in the Main phase, the turn player regains control of the Main phase. 

8. The turn player is the first player to receive Opportunity whenever Opportunity arises at the beginning of most phases and steps of phases, after the completion of turn-based actions, or after the topmost layer of the Effects Stack resolves. 

a. After a player activates or materializes a card, activates an ability, they receive Opportunity by default even if they are not the turn player. In this manner, players can maintain Opportunity and commit to multiple consecutive player actions. 

However, pending actions cannot be resolved until they pass Opportunity and all players have had a chance to pass Opportunity in turn order. 

State-based effects and turn-based actions will always happen before players receive Opportunity to act. 

If a player were to receive Opportunity, state-based effects are first checked and the game will perform any necessary state-based actions before players have the Opportunity to act. 

If all players pass on Opportunity while the Effects Stack is empty, the game will automatically proceed to the next phase. 

Situations in which Opportunity arises:

• At the beginning of Recollection and End Phases

• After a card or ability enters the Effects Stack. \(This can refer to materializations, activations, or triggers. Opportunity passes before resolution of that card or ability.\) 135

18/06/2025, 20:36

Grand Archive Comprehensive Rules v1.1.1

• At the beginning of the retaliation step and damage step of the combat phase

• At the beginning of the main phase \(turn player receives Opportunity and can perform Slow player actions\)

• After an activation, trigger, or materialization resolves and there is another effect on the Effects Stack or a pending turn-based action

**Special Play Permissions**

Some effects will grant a player the ability to play, activate, or materialize a card they might not normally have the ability to. These effects will explicitly give permission to a player as to the context of time and duration that the permission is granted. These permissions will typically override or overrule any default cases, such as Fast or Slow stats on cards, as well as the zones from which a card can be played. 

1. If a card states a given player "activate/play/materialize a card" \(with or without a may\) without establishing a duration for this effect, the permission is assumed to be given only as part of the effect and is considered an instruction to the player, just as an effect may state "Draw 2 cards." After the effect has been completely resolved, any permission granted expires. This permission will allow players to seemingly activate cards with Slow play permissions while the Effects Stack is not empty. 

136





18/06/2025, 20:36

Grand Archive Comprehensive Rules v1.1.1



E.g. For cards such as Quicksilver Grail or Beseech The Winds, the player is granted permission to play the banished card or is instructed to materialize a card and is granted permission to do so through the effect, bypassing normal timing permissions. 

137



18/06/2025, 20:36

Grand Archive Comprehensive Rules v1.1.1

2. If, on the other hand, an effect specifies a duration or conditions \("as long as. ."\) modifying the play permission, the play permissions are altered or granted only after the effect has fully resolved and a player must still abide by any permissions that were not overridden. These effects will typically modify permissions for zones from which a card is played rather than explicitly grant permissions that allow Slow vs Fast play permissions to be overridden. 

E.g. Naia grants permission to activate the Spell from banishment "as long as you control Naia." 

This permission is only granted after the effect fully resolves rather than being instructed play/activate/materialize a card. As a result, only the permission to activate it from banishment is added to the normal permissions and play timings of Fast vs Slow will still apply. 

138

18/06/2025, 20:36

Grand Archive Comprehensive Rules v1.1.1

**Game Mechanics - Damage**

1. Damage dealt is always calculated at the resolution of an event and is calculated based on all damage-modifying factors. 

2. Damage is classified as Combat damage and non-Combat damage. Any damage dealt during the resolution of the damage step of the combat phase is dealt as Combat damage. Non-Combat damage includes most other instances of damage being dealt, such as by action cards or by abilities. 

3. Damage can also be characterized as unpreventable damage. This indicates that prevention effects will not be able to prevent that damage. 

4. Ally damage is inflicted according to the power stat denoted on the ally card in addition to damage modifiers. Each power stat point on an ally results in one damage dealt per attack point by that ally. 

5. Each power stat point on a card in the intent or weapon used during an attack results in one damage per power when a champion attacks. The same is true for any power-increasing modifiers or effects. 

6. A champion can declare an attack with more than 0 power. The attack still happens if the power is reduced to 0 or less after the attack was declared and durability from a weapon is removed normally during the damage step. 

7. If an effect were to prevent damage, that damage does not happen; it is not simply reduced. 

8. No player actions may be taken during the time damage is dealt to units and the time in which those units are determined to be destroyed or banished as a result. 

9. Damage is only considered dealt and objects are only considered hit whenever the value of damage taken is greater than 0. 

10. The designated object for a damage source will always be the object dealing damage. 

a. For attacks, the damage source is considered to be the attacking unit. 

i. Whenever a champion deals combat damage, it will be considered the sole source of damage regardless of whether it used an attack card, a weapon, or both for the attack. 

b. For actions dealing damage, the action is considered the source of damage. 

c. The object that owns the ability is considered the source of damage for abilities dealing damage. 

139

18/06/2025, 20:36

Grand Archive Comprehensive Rules v1.1.1

11. If an effect on a card states to “Deal X damage” where X is a damage value defined by the card, that card marks that much damage on the chosen target. 

12. Damage marked on allies is considered “temporary damage” and is removed during the end phase before the start of the next turn. 

13. Damage is marked permanently on champions in the form of damage counters which stay until removed by another effect \(such as via the Recover mechanic\) or until it is equal to or exceeds the life of that champion, at which point that champion dies \(this often causes that champion's controller to lose the game\). 

Champions with Immortality will not die from having damage counters equal to or greater than their life stat. 

14. The element typing of a damage source is considered the element of the source. 

E.g. If a Luxem, Fire, and Norm element champion attacks with a Water attack card, the damage source typing is only Luxem, Fire, and Norm. 

15. Negative amounts of damage can’t be dealt; if less than 0 damage would be dealt, no damage \(0 damage\) is dealt instead. 

16. When damage is dealt, the number of damage instances depends on the wording of the card. If one quantity of damage is applied to a set of objects, it is considered a single damage event for that source. If multiple instances of damage or multiple targets are individually selected, this is considered multiple damage events. 

140





18/06/2025, 20:36

Grand Archive Comprehensive Rules v1.1.1

E.g. Purge in Flames would be considered to deal damage only once while Slime Eruption would be seen as having as many damage instances as the number of times a unit was chosen, even if it was the same unit.

**Game Mechanics - Damage Prevention**

Damage prevention, usually provided by replacement effects, can either reduce, wholly or in part, the damage that would be taken by a unit. 

Prevention effects can also be continuous effects. 

Damage prevention will follow the order of determining replacement effects as described under Replacement Effects. 

Damage prevention may be characterized by damage types, such as attack or non-combat damage. If a type is specified, the prevention effect will only reduce the damage of that type. If no type is specified, damage prevention will act upon any type of damage, regardless of type. 

Damage prevention quantities can be divided into categories of “shielding” versus 

“instance” damage prevention effects. 

1. Shielding damage prevention effects will create a damage buffer that absorbs a certain amount of damage. In this case, the buffer will only be reduced if the damage prevented is greater than zero. Any damage exceeding the buffered/shielded amount will still be dealt as normal. 

E.g. A player using Deflecting Edge which prevents the next 3 Combat damage that would be dealt to their champion would not be able to reduce 3 unpreventable damage from an attack, but will still be able to reduce 3 combat damage from a subsequent attack. Similarly, Clarent, Sword of Peace’s ability will still make a 1 damage buffer that will persist through an unpreventable non-attack source, only to be used for a normal non-attack source. 

143





18/06/2025, 20:36

Grand Archive Comprehensive Rules v1.1.1

2. Instance damage prevention effects will not track the amount of damage to be absorbed but will instead try to prevent some or all of that damage. In this case, the instance of prevention will still be used up if the amount of damage prevented was zero, 144

18/06/2025, 20:36

Grand Archive Comprehensive Rules v1.1.1

as long as there was still an attempt at damage prevention. If damage exceeds a quantity set by a prevention instance, the remaining damage will be dealt as normal. 

Prevention effects will persist as long as the effect is specified. 

In the case of unpreventable damage, prevention effects will still attempt to prevent that damage in one instance. Unpreventable damage will not detract from “shielding”-type prevention effects \(See above\)

Prevention effects will specify which units will be affected under the damage prevention. If prevention is applied to each unit or multiple specified units a player controls, the instances of prevention effects are tracked independently for each unit. However, if an effect uses the wording “the next time \[damage threshold\] \[damage type\] would be dealt to one or more 

\[designated units\],” that instance will only be prevented once, regardless of how many units are controlled. 

Prevention can also specify the source of damage for damage instances, such as allies, champions, or actions/spells of certain classes. 

If prevention is a given as a whole number, that many points of damage can be subtracted from the damage calculation when damage is dealt. 

Damage prevention can have additional effects tied to the replacement effect. In these cases, the entire effect is part of the replacement effect. If any delayed triggered ability is dependent upon the prevention of damage are to be made, they will be separated by a paragraph break and listed as a separate effect on a new line. 

E.g. Spellshield: Arcane specifies to put enlighten counters on a champion equal to the amount of damage prevented. This is in the same text paragraph as the damage prevention effect and so the enlighten counters will be placed as part of the damage prevention replacement effect, not underneath a separate trigger.

**Game Mechanics - Drawing Cards**

1. Events that result in a drawn card force the player to take the top card of their deck and place it into their hand or their memory as specified. 

2. A drawn card is a discrete event. 

a. The same is true for other events where a card from the deck is taken and moved to another zone, e.g. Banishing the top three cards of a deck will see each card individually banished sequentially, as one complete player action. 

E.g., a player drawing N cards requires that player to draw one card N times. This occurs within one effective player action and no Opportunity to act as a result of this arises. 

3. If an effect is placed into the Effects Stack due to a player drawing a card, this effect takes place after all N cards are drawn. 

4. Cards being selected from one or more revealed cards from the deck and added into the hand is not considered drawing a card. In every case where a player would be instructed to draw a card by an event, the rules state the words “Draw X cards” where X 

is the number of cards to be drawn. 

5. If a player would otherwise be told to place a card from anywhere in their deck into their hand or their memory, this is not considered to be drawing a card unless the rules text of the effect states the word “draw.” 

6. A player attempting to draw a card from their deck without having any remaining cards in the deck results in an automatic loss, i.e. decking out. 

147

18/06/2025, 20:36

Grand Archive Comprehensive Rules v1.1.1

**Game Mechanics - Counters**

Counters are a special attribute of an object that holds both a type and numeric value. 

Depending on the type, counters will have various effects or enable certain abilities. 

Counters can be tracked by using tokens, dice, or an agreed method by players in a game to denote the number and type of each counter on an object. 

The quantity of a type of counter can be positively modified by gaining and negatively modified by spending to pay for a cost, or by loss/removal as a result of an effect. 

Counters persist on an object or card in a zone as long as that card or object does not change zones. Cards being moved to another zone will cause its counters to be lost. 

Counters can be subdivided into generic or special counters. Special counters have specific rules associated with the counter itself whereas generic counters do not grant or have inherent abilities/effects associated with them. Counters are considered generic if they are not listed below:

**Buff**

1. Buff counters statically modify an object’s power and life stats by \+1 to each of those stats for every buff counter on that object. 

2. If the object does not have a power or life stat, that stat will not be generated due to a buff counter being placed on that object. 

3. Modifications from buff counters will be applied before any other changes to the base power and life stats of an ally. 

4. If buff counters are placed on an object with debuff counters, each buff counter will remove itself and a corresponding debuff counter. 

**Damage**

1. Damage counters are permanent counters on champions that are placed whenever a champion is dealt any type of damage. 

2. Damage counters will mark damage in whole numbers starting from 0. 

148

18/06/2025, 20:36

Grand Archive Comprehensive Rules v1.1.1

3. Damage counters reaching or exceeding the life stat of a champion is a condition that causes that champion to die or become defeated and a player loses if all of their champions die or are defeated. 

4. Damage counters are removed by effects that Recover. 

**Debuff**

1. Debuff counters statically modify an object’s power and life stats by -1 to each of those stats for every debuff counter on that object. 

2. If the object does not have a power or life stat, that stat will not be generated due to a debuff counter being placed on that object. 

3. Modifications from debuff counters will be applied before any other changes to the base power and life stats of an ally. 

4. If debuff counters are placed on an object with buff counters, each debuff counter will remove itself and a corresponding buff counter. 

**Durability**

1. Cards with a durability stat will enter the field with a number of durability counters equal to that stat. 

2. Durability counters on an object can exceed the printed durability stat of an object. 

3. Weapons and Siegeable objects will be destroyed by state-based effects if their durability reaches 0. 

4. If the object does not have a durability stat, the stat will not be generated as a result of a durability counter being placed on that object. 

**Enlighten**

1. Enlighten counters have the following ability: “Remove 3 enlighten counters from 

\[CARDNAME\]: Draw a card." 

**Level**

1. Level counters on champions give that champion \+1 Level for each level counter on that champion. 

149

18/06/2025, 20:36

Grand Archive Comprehensive Rules v1.1.1

**Wither**

1. At the beginning of a player's main phase, if they control one or more objects with a wither counter on them, for each of those objects, they sacrifice it unless they pay 1 

reserve for each wither counter in it, then remove those counters. 

2. The triggered ability is sourced from the game rather than the objects on which the wither-related trigger originates. 

3. The reserve cost to be paid for each object must be paid in full. If it is not completely paid, that object is sacrificed. 

4. All wither counters are removed at the same time during the resolution of the triggered ability. 

5. There is only one main phase per turn; wither will not create another trigger after returning to the main phase after combat if any wither counters were placed in a combat phase.

**Game Mechanics - Mastery**

Masteries are special non-object player functions and are typically granted by various effects. Players can only have one mastery at a time. 

1. If you get another mastery, it replaces your current mastery. 

2. Cards interacting with certain masteries may have symbols and icons related to that mastery on the card. 

3. Cards that track and represent masteries cannot be placed or used in any decks \(Main, Material\) and only serve to visually reflect the active Mastery. 

List of Masteries:

**Shifting Currents**

1. Shifting Currents has four modes. Each mode is represented as a "direction" of either North, South, East, or West. Shifting Currents can only be set to one mode at a time and changing the mode will remove whatever mode it was previously set to. 

151

18/06/2025, 20:36

Grand Archive Comprehensive Rules v1.1.1

a. The starting mode is in the North direction. 

b. If a card's rules text references any of Shifting Currents' modes, it will be reflected as direction icons on the bottom left of the card. 

2. An adjacent direction for shifting currents is defined as the following: North and South are each adjacent to both West and East; West and East are each adjacent to both North and South.

Grand Archive Comprehensive Rules v1.1.1

**Tracking Information**

Trackable information includes marked champion damage and the various counters that can be placed on objects. 

Players may track temporary marked damage on allies using similar methods, however, players must clear this tracked damage at the end of each turn to properly represent the game state. 

Multiple objects may be used to keep track of any counters on an object, such as dice, coins, or other countable markers or symbols. 

154

18/06/2025, 20:36

Grand Archive Comprehensive Rules v1.1.1

**Permission**

In all situations, rules text of cards, or effects that restrict a player from performing a player action using the words “can't” or “may not” overrule any effects that grant permission for that player to perform that player action if both effects are static. 

155

18/06/2025, 20:36

Grand Archive Comprehensive Rules v1.1.1

**Concession**

At any point in the game, a player may choose to concede the game. 

1. In a two-player game, the opponent of the player immediately wins the game. 

2. In a multiplayer game, the game will continue considering that the player to have lost until there is a winner of the game. 

Conceding is not bound by any timing restrictions and may be done at any point in the game. 

Conceding supersedes any effects that specify that the conceding player cannot lose the game. 

After a game result is obtained through a concession, any subsequent games will follow as normal, following format conventions and match structures. 

156

18/06/2025, 20:36

Grand Archive Comprehensive Rules v1.1.1

**Randomization**

Randomization in this game is used to determine outcomes of random events and the random ordering of decks after shuffling. 

For a method to determine outcomes to be random, an object used to generate a random result must be fair. 

1. Objects considered fair include dice with two or more sides in which each side has an equal chance of resulting after tossing that object. 

2. A fair coin is acceptable as a two-sided die for this purpose. 

When selecting random events, a die with more sides than results needed to be determined can be used if it is easily scalable or if there is a fair method agreed upon among players to determine results. 

E.g. if a player must banish a card among five from memory, a D20 \(20-sided die\) may be used where values 1-4 are assigned to the card in the 1st position, 5-8 are assigned to the card in the 2nd position, 9-12 for the 3rd position, 13-16 for the 4th position, and 17-20 for the 5th position. 

Sufficient shuffling and randomization of cards that are not uniquely identifiable and having an opponent choose from among those cards are considered a fair selection method. 

For shuffling a deck, only methods that generate a sufficiently random state may be used. 

1. The deck shuffled must be in plain view of your opponent and/or event judge. 

2. After a player shuffles a deck, they present their deck to an opponent to cut or further shuffle the deck.

**Rounding**

If a situation would require rounding a numeric value, that number is rounded down to the nearest whole number. 

158

18/06/2025, 20:36

Grand Archive Comprehensive Rules v1.1.1

**Searching and Finding**

Searching means looking through a set of cards, typically to select one or more cards from that group for a purpose. Finding a card is selecting a card or cards from that set. 

1. Effects that specify to search for or find a card with certain characteristics \(cost, name, element, etc.\) in a private zone, the player has the option to not choose a card, even if there is a legal choice. This can be considered an optional "failure to find." If there is a legal choice among revealed cards or legal choices among public cards, players do not have the option to decline choosing the legal card, i.e., they cannot opt for a failure to find. 

2. If an effect specifies that a player would find or search for a card without defined characteristics \(simply stated as "a card"\), a card must be chosen if there is at least one legal choice. Players cannot fail to find a card in this case. 

3. Some effects may ask a player to move or put a card from one zone or set of cards to another. This action requires that a player search for a card with the matching or required characteristics to proceed with moving that card. If a card has no characteristic, such as face-down cards or cards in private zones, it cannot be a legal target for any characteristic-defined searches. 

Any time an effect would specify that a player would search for or activate a card from a zone or that a player would materialize a card from the material deck, that effect resolves and proceeds if no card is a legal choice or no card is found. There will not be a change in game state.

**Special Game Actions**

**and Turn-based Actions**

Special and turn-based game actions are events that either a player takes or which the game will perform that cannot be responded to by any players in any circumstances. 

No players are considered the source for turn-based actions. 

Opportunity is never given nor are players able to obtain Opportunity during special and turn-based actions being completed. 

Special game actions are excluded from modifications to game rules by rules text of cards and effects. 

E.g. Eternal Magistrate can't prevent Lv 0 Spirit champions from being placed onto the field during a player's first turn as this is a special game action. 

Special game actions:

160

18/06/2025, 20:36

Grand Archive Comprehensive Rules v1.1.1

• Putting into play a Level 0 champion at the start of the game. This also does not count as a materialization. 

• Player concession

• During the end phase:

◦ Removal of temporary marked damage

◦ Ending end-of-turn effects \("until end of turn, this turn, as your turn ends," etc.\)

◦ Discarding down to imposed hand size limits. 

Turn-based actions:

• Waking up objects as part of the Wake Up phase

• Players returning cards from their memory to their hands as part of recollection

• Players drawing a card as they enter the draw phase. 

• Damage being dealt simultaneously during the damage step of the combat phase. 

161

18/06/2025, 20:36

Grand Archive Comprehensive Rules v1.1.1

**State-based Checks and Effects**

State-based effects occur as a result of conditions in the state of the game being met and often do not require any additional input from the player to be completed. 

Checks to see if state-based conditions are met happen every time the state of the game changes in the time between a player losing or passing Opportunity and the moment at which another player receives Opportunity. 

Game-ending Checks: The game will first make a pass to validate whether any conditions that result in a player having won or lost a game to be checked. 

Damage: If enough damage is marked on a unit to bring that unit’s life to 0 or less, the unit will die. 

Durability: If a weapon has no durability counters, the weapon will be destroyed. 

Unique Objects: If a player controls 2 or more unique objects with the same name, the game will force the player to choose one of them to keep, and the player must sacrifice the rest of those objects before the game continues. 

Copy: If a copy of a card activation is sent to a zone other than the Effects Stack, it will cease to exist unless it has a corresponding card. If a copy of an object is sent to a zone other than the field, it will cease to exist unless the copy has a corresponding card. 

Clean-Up: The game will remove all ally damage counters, “until end of turn” or one-shot effects, and other temporary conditions at the end of each turn. If any limitations would be placed on players such as maximum hand sizes, the active player must fulfill actions to fulfill such limitations before the game continues. 

Combat Roles: Combat roles of attacking/defending/retaliating units will immediately end as soon as an attacking unit no longer has a valid attack target, a defending unit is no longer an attack target or the retaliating unit no longer has a valid retaliation target, respectively. 

162

18/06/2025, 20:36

Grand Archive Comprehensive Rules v1.1.1

**Player Action Legality**

A player action is considered illegal if it directly contradicts any of the above rules of the game and results in a game state that can't be resolved. 

If a card’s rules text contradicts the rules of the game, the card’s rules take precedence. In all cases, “can’t” overrules “can” if there are conflicting effects of the same kind. 

A player action is not illegal if it is simply unclear and the case should be brought to an event judge or game authority. 

A situation is unclear if both players in a game reach different conclusions regarding the outcome of an event or process within the game. 

If necessary, the ruling goes through an official process via a rules committee for amendment of the game rules. 

163

18/06/2025, 20:36

Grand Archive Comprehensive Rules v1.1.1

**Naming**

The source of an ability is considered the object that generated the ability, whether the ability was triggered or activated. If any effects are dependent upon the characteristics of the source object and that object were to no longer exist at the time the associated ability resolves, it will consider last-known characteristics or values. 

Each card will always refer to itself as “this card” when it is a non-object card. 

Cards will use the printed name of the card when it becomes an object. 

Any references to that name are self-referential and an ability will only refer to other objects with the same name explicitly. 

Each ability that refers to its source by its object name will only refer to the source of those abilities and not any other objects by the same name. 

Self-referential names in the rules text of an object can be dynamically changed if another object gains that ability or becomes a copy of that object with a different name. 

E.g. A Tome of Sacred Lightning that has banished a Tome of Knowledge after activation will have “Banish Tome of Sacred Lightning: Draw a card.” rather than “Banish Tome of Knowledge.” 

164





18/06/2025, 20:36

Grand Archive Comprehensive Rules v1.1.1

Some cards ask a player to name a card or to choose a card name. When instructed to do so, the player must reference the desired card by name explicitly \(or through a detailed 165

18/06/2025, 20:36

Grand Archive Comprehensive Rules v1.1.1

description for mutual understanding\). The card instructing to choose a name will consider the specified cards for its effects. 

1. Tokens are not considered cards and can't be named. 

166

18/06/2025, 20:36

Grand Archive Comprehensive Rules v1.1.1

**Effects**

Effects are considered to be all of the rules text of an ability that impacts that game. 

Some effects may state that a player “may” \(do something\) as it is resolving. The effect is in this case is optional and the player or players only must decide whether they opt for the effect as the ability is being resolved. 

Some effects will use the word “unless.” These effects will generally check for a specified condition and will change their behaviors based on whether or not that condition is satisfied or absent. These abilities may also use the words “If not” to represent an alternative effect. 

167

18/06/2025, 20:36

Grand Archive Comprehensive Rules v1.1.1

**Copy**

Some cards or abilities can become a copy of a card, object, or ability, or may generate an object that is a copy of a card, object, or ability. Copying can refer to the effect of copying an object or card activation. A copy can refer to the copied card, object, or ability. A copied card, object, or ability, is still considered an activation/materialization and can be targeted as such. 

**Copying Objects**

1. When an object is copied, the new copy has all characteristics of the base printing of the current face of that card without any modifiers such as counters, rested/awake statuses, or other continuous one-shot effects applied to the card. 

a. Some properties that affect the card \(as opposed to just the object the card has become\) can be copied, such as: Imbued. 

2. Any choices or modes made while the original was on the field do not count as copiable information or characteristics for the new object. If any abilities ask that a player choose an effect, this choice is not impacted by nor will it impact the original object’s choice. E.g., If a copy was made of Nia, Mistveiled Scout, the copy’s controller may choose a different card name from what was named by the original Nia while the new object’s On Enter ability is resolving. The new Nia will not “remember” the card chosen from the original. 

3. Any subsequent changes to the original copy will not cause any changes in characteristics to any of the copies of the original. 

4. When an object is copied, the copied object is solely used to reference characteristics, regardless of whether or not the copied object is itself a copy. 

5. Copying a transformed card will cause the copy to have only the characteristics of the transformed side. This copy will not be able to transform unless it has the correct and corresponding default side. 

**Static Copying**

1. Some objects may enter the field as a copy of another object. If it does, the generated object will act as if it enters as the original card with any On Enter abilities being placed onto the Effects Stack, if able. Otherwise, it will copy all other characteristics as point 1 

made above. 

168

18/06/2025, 20:36

Grand Archive Comprehensive Rules v1.1.1

2. Entering as a copy is not a triggered ability like On Enter. 

**Copying Abilities or Copying Card Activations**

1. Copying an ability or card activation will cause another instance of that ability or card to be placed onto the Effects Stack with any chosen modes, alternative costs, values of X, or other choices made during activation to be identical to the new copy. 

2. Any choices made during resolution are separate from those made during activation and may be different. 

3. If there is any property or characteristic of cards or objects associated with the activation, that information is also copied. 

E.g. an Imbued action activation that is copied will produce an Imbued copy. 

4. A copied activation of a card with an object type \(such as Ally or Item\) will cause the copied activation to enter as a token copy of that object with any characteristics matching those of the printed values. 

Copied card activations and copied objects are under the control of the player who generated the copy. 

A copied ability has the same source as the original ability activation and references by name will refer to the source of the original ability. 

Copy effects that state a player may choose new targets or modes for the copied ability or card activation allows the player to choose new targets or modes. This will not allow the player to modify any choices made in activating the original copy. 

169

18/06/2025, 20:36

Grand Archive Comprehensive Rules v1.1.1

**Properties and States**

Properties are characteristics of a card or object relating to its individual information or certain mutable or temporary characteristics. Some cards or effects may reference or depend upon these properties. A state is a mode of a property or a way in which that property can be set. 

If a state of a property were to try to be set to the state it already is in, the state will not change. 

E.g. If an object or card were in the "rested" state, resting that card or object will not cause that card to "become rested" — it will simply be rested and the game will not observe a change in the card's state. 

General Card Properties

1. Facing: The facing of a card is a property with states of being either face-up or face-down. This property is used to determine whether its information is considered public or private. 

a. Face-down cards in all zones except for the field have no properties except for being a card or set properties or characteristics defined by abilities or effects. 

b. If a private card is set face-down in a specific zone with that card being selected due to its characteristics or properties, these cards must be revealed at the end of the game. 

2. Orientation: The orientation of a card is a property with states of being either Awake or Rested. This property is typically used for objects to determine whether they may rest to pay for some costs or to retaliate, if they are defending units. 

**Activation Properties**

• Prepared

• Imbued

• Brewed

170

18/06/2025, 20:36

Grand Archive Comprehensive Rules v1.1.1

For activation properties, the default state is "not prepared" or "not imbued." 

**Properties and States of Objects**

• Attacking \(or non-attacking\)

• Defending \(or non-defending\)

• Retaliating \(or non-retaliating\)

• Orientation \(Awake vs Rested as states\)

• Damaged \(or Undamaged\)

• Intercepting \(or non-intercepting\)

• Distant \(or non-Distant\)

• Fostered \(or Unfostered\)

• Loaded \(or Unloaded\)

• Brewed \(or not Brewed\)

• Imbued \(or not Imbued\)

• Prepared \(or not Prepared\)

• Preserved \(or not Preserved\)

Objects will default to being Awake. For all other state pairs among the listed properties, the property will be "off" \(or non- / un- \) by default.

Grand Archive Comprehensive Rules v1.1.1

**Card and Object Information**

Information on cards or objects considers aspects including status, characteristics, stats, counters, activation/materialization modes, costs paid, and any information related to the abilities of the card or object. Essentially, all of the details necessary to determine effects, state-based actions, and interactions in a game state are carried by cards and objects within the game. 

Sometimes, this information is checked when a card or object changes or would change zones. In this case, last-known information is used. Last-known information examines all of the aforementioned aspects of the object in the context where a card or object has changed zones from the point the required information for an effect is examined. **Therefore, last-known information is defined as the information the card or object had before leaving the** **zone it was supposed to be in during the check. **This information only examines the last zone and cannot relate information about the card or object it was across two or more zone changes. Both On Leave and On Death abilities use last-known information for their effects. 

E.g. In the case of Slime King, the Slime King ally can track information from the activation of the Slime King card. When the On Leave ability triggers and Slime King has left the field, the 172

18/06/2025, 20:36

Grand Archive Comprehensive Rules v1.1.1

ability will examine the information on the Slime ally cards carried by the Slime King object, even though it would have left the field. 

173

18/06/2025, 20:36

Grand Archive Comprehensive Rules v1.1.1

**Default Case**

All rules listed in this document are considered the default cases for resolving player actions and game states within a match and do not account for changes in rules structure permitted or disallowed by various effects that may occur within a game. 

Rules text of cards and any specified abilities will supersede the base/default rules of the game. 

174

18/06/2025, 20:36

Grand Archive Comprehensive Rules v1.1.1

**Glossary**

This section will explain terms found throughout the game of Grand Archive. Terms are divided into two categories:

• Keywords and Abilities

• Game Terms

175

18/06/2025, 20:36

Grand Archive Comprehensive Rules v1.1.1

**Keywords and Abilities**

In this section, \[CARDNAME\] refers to the implied name of the card itself. 

Redundant keyworded abilities will ignore any mentions of that ability on a card or effect beyond the first. 

**Agility N**

1. Agility N is a triggered ability that means "Return N cards from your memory to your hand at the beginning of the end phase." 

2. You get to pick which cards are returned to your hand. 

3. If you have less cards in your memory than you can return to your hand from Agility, you return as many cards to your hand as you can. 

4. Multiple instances of Agility on a card will generate separate triggers during the end phase. 

**Ambush**

1. Ambush is a static ability of units which means "This unit may retaliate against attackers while it isn't defending." 

2. The unit must still be awake to retaliate against attackers. 

**Brew**

1. Brew is a static ability that allows cards to be activated using an alternative cost involving sacrificing ingredients \(typically summoned by gathering\). The Brew keyword will list the objects needed for the alternative cost. 

2. Brew means "You may sacrifice the listed objects rather than pay this card's reserve cost." 

3. Activating a card using the Brew cost can still be modified by additional activation cost modifiers. Effects that modify the reserve cost are ignored when Brewing cards. 

**Champion Bonus**

176

18/06/2025, 20:36

Grand Archive Comprehensive Rules v1.1.1

1. Champion bonuses are restriction abilities that define a bonus effect or replacement effect for a card that is enabled if and only if the player’s champion’s lineage name matches the specified champion name of the restriction ability. 

2. Champion Bonuses function in all zones. 

3. If a card with a champion bonus ability lists a champion whose name differs from the name of the champion\(s\) controlled by a player such that the condition for a class bonus is not met, the keywords and effects associated with the bonus are ignored as part of the rules text in every zone. 

**Class Bonus**

1. Class Bonus is a restriction ability that defines a bonus effect or replacement effect for a card that is enabled if and only if a player’s champion’s class matches the class of the card or object. 

2. To unlock a class bonus, a player’s champion must match at least one of the classes on the card with class bonus that player controls. 

3. Class Bonus functions in all zones. 

4. If a card with class bonus and a champion differ such that the condition for a class bonus is not met, the keywords and effects associated with the bonus are ignored as part of the rules text in every zone. 

E.g., Merlin, Memory Thief banishing a Flame-Rune Swordsman from the graveyard of a player controlling Tristan, Grim Stalker does not gain a level counter upon resolving Merlin’s ability.

Grand Archive Comprehensive Rules v1.1.1

**Cleave**

178

18/06/2025, 20:36

Grand Archive Comprehensive Rules v1.1.1

1. Cleave is a static ability of attacks, weapons, and units that allows them to attack all attackable objects a chosen opponent controls. 

a. Attackable objects include Siegeable domains. 

2. Cleave attacks can’t be intercepted. 

3. Attacks with cleave involve only one combat step; damage is done simultaneously to each defending unit and retaliation is selected for each defending unit during the retaliation step of that combat. 

4. Defending allies for a combat step initiated by a Cleave attack are designated during attack declaration. Any units that enter the field under the defending player’s control will not be designated as defenders and will not be involved in combat as defenders. 

E.g. A player chosen for a Cleave attack activates and resolves Blanche, Sheltering Saint at the beginning of the retaliation step of combat. Blanche would not be considered a defending unit and would not be able to retaliate nor would be dealt damage during the damage step. 

179





18/06/2025, 20:36

Grand Archive Comprehensive Rules v1.1.1

5. An attack with Cleave may be retaliated against by each defending unit. 

6. Each damage calculation is done independently but damage resolution happens simultaneously. 

180

18/06/2025, 20:36

Grand Archive Comprehensive Rules v1.1.1

7. Damage done as a result of an attack with Cleave only causes the loss of one durability counter on a weapon if that weapon is used with the attack. 

8. Multiple instances of Cleave are redundant. 

**Critical N**

1. Critical N is a static ability which means “If this would deal combat damage, instead double that damage unless an opponent discards N cards.” 

2. Any opponent may discard N cards even if a unit they control is not receiving the damage. 

3. Multiple instances of critical stack from a single source additively. E.g. An ally with both Critical 2 and Critical 3 will require opponents to, in any combination, discard 2 and 3 

cards, otherwise the damage is doubled. Damage will only be doubled once, regardless of how many instances of Critical are involved. 

**Command**

1. Command is a static ability on Command Attack that invokes an additional cost and modifies the attack card so that it is performed through an ally rather than a champion. 

2. Commands have an additional cost of resting an ally \(it must be awake\). The Command keyword may include a subtype that specifies which ally type must be rested. 

3. After an attack with the Command keyword resolves, a combat phase will begin with the rested ally as the attacker rather than a chosen champion. The attack card added to the rested ally's intent for the combat phase. 

a. Commands that resolve without a valid target will not create a combat phase; the rested ally will not enter combat. 

b. The ally must still obey its controller to attack. This means if a condition such as Pride is not met, the attack will fail to begin, no combat phase will start, and the attack card will enter the graveyard. The ally would remain rested. 

Damage will be dealt by a unit according to its damage stat and the damage stats of any cards in its intent. 

**Divine Relic**

181

18/06/2025, 20:36

Grand Archive Comprehensive Rules v1.1.1

1. Divine Relic is a static ability which means “You can only have one card with this keyword in your material deck.” 

**Efficiency**

1. Efficiency is a cost-modifying static ability for a card or ability which means “This card costs LV less to activate” \(LV refers to your champion’s level\). 

2. Efficiency functions only while a card is being placed onto the Effects Stack. 

**Element Bonus**

1. Element Bonus is a restriction ability that defines a bonus effect or replacement effect for a card that is enabled if and only if the player’s champion’s element\(s\) matches the element of the card or object. 

2. Element Bonus functions in all zones. 

**Empower N**

1. Empower is a static ability which means "The next Spell card you activate this turn activates and resolves as if your champion got \+N level\(s\)" 

a. Empower must take a value greater than 0 to happen; a spell will not be empowered if an effect gave Empower 0. 

2. Empower is granted to the player that controls the card or effect granting Empower. It is applied as a continuous effect that is used and applied as soon as the Empowered player activates their next Spell card. 

a. Empower is not applied as an effect to the activated card, but the card can check if it is being empowered by the player. 

3. Multiple instances of empower stack additively. 

**Floating Memory**

1. Floating Memory is a static ability which means “While paying for a memory cost, you may banish this card from your graveyard to pay for 1 of that cost.” 

2. When paying a memory cost, the part of the cost paid with floating memory must be declared before determining the number of cards that are randomly banished as part of 182

18/06/2025, 20:36

Grand Archive Comprehensive Rules v1.1.1

paying for memory costs. 

3. Floating memory is redundant. 

**Fast Activation**

1. Fast Activation is a static ability which means “You may activate this card at fast speed.” 

2. Fast Activation is redundant. 

**Foster**

1. Foster is a triggered ability which means “At the beginning of your recollection phase, if this ally hasn't been dealt damage since the end of your previous turn, it becomes fostered.” 

2. Any unit may become fostered, but units can’t make themselves fostered without the Foster keyword. 

3. Foster is redundant. 

**Hindered**

1. Hindered is a static ability which means, "This object enters the field rested." 

2. Hindered is redundant. 

**Imbue N**

1. Imbue is an static ability which means, “You may reserve all cards revealed as you activate this card. If at least N of them are <element matching the card>, this card becomes imbued." 

2. Fulfilling the condition of the imbue ability will cause the card that resolves or the object the card would become to be imbued. 

3. Cards that are set in the memory zone revealed are not revealed from the memory zone. They are just placed face-up in the memory zone. This means it will not trigger off of cards being revealed from memory. 

4. Cards revealed for Imbue will be turned face down after the card is successfully activated and placed on the effects stack. 

183

18/06/2025, 20:36

Grand Archive Comprehensive Rules v1.1.1

5. If a card has multiple instances of Imbue, only the smallest value of N needs to be met for a card to be imbued. 

**Immortality**

1. Immortality is a static ability which means “This object can’t be sent from the field to the graveyard.” 

a. Immortal objects do not die; they do not go to the graveyard as a result of having 0 

or less life. 

b. Immortal objects can’t be destroyed \(including via sacrifice\). 

2. If a player controls multiple Immortal objects that are unique and have the same name, a player will still be forced to put one of those objects into their graveyard as a state-based effect as a result of breaking the Unique rule. 

a. This counts as dying or being destroyed. 

3. Immortality is redundant. 

**Inherited Effect**

1. An Inherited Effect is a static ability applied to champion cards which means “Your champion has this ability as long as this card is part of its lineage.” 

2. Inherited Effect only functions while the card with the ability is in a Lineage. 

**Intercept**

1. Intercept is a triggered ability which means “Whenever your champion is attacked while this ally is awake, you may redirect that attack to this ally.” 

a. The ally must still be a valid target for the attack to be redirected. 

2. If an ally with intercept does not obey a player, the resolution of the intercept ability will fail and that ally will not be able to intercept. The trigger still occurs and Opportunity is presented if a player has any effects that might cause that ally to obey the controlling player. 

a. Intercept will trigger, but will not allow the player to make that ally intercept if that ally does not obey that player. 

3. Intercept is redundant. 

184

18/06/2025, 20:36

Grand Archive Comprehensive Rules v1.1.1

**Kindle N**

1. Kindle is a static ability which means "you may banish up to N fire element cards fromyour graveyard as you activate this card. Each one pays for 1 reserve of this card's cost." 

2. Kindle does not modify a card's cost characteristics regardless of how its payment is opted for. 

**Level Restriction**

1. Level Restrictions \(formatted as bubbles with Level N\+\) are restriction abilities that check if a player’s champion is at least level N. 

2. Level Restrictions function in all zones. 

**Lineage \(Keyword\)**

1. Lineage is a static restriction ability for leveling up a champion which means 

“\[CARDNAME\] must be leveled from a previous level ‘X’ champion” where X is the character name of the previous champion. 

E.g., Lorraine, Wandering Warrior is a Lorraine champion and would be a valid condition for leveling into Lorraine, Blademaster. 

185





18/06/2025, 20:36

Grand Archive Comprehensive Rules v1.1.1

**Lineage Release**

186

18/06/2025, 20:36

Grand Archive Comprehensive Rules v1.1.1

1. Lineage Release is an activated ability that says “activate this ability by banishing this card from your champion’s inner lineage.” 

2. Lineage Release abilities on one card do not allow a player to banish another card with a Lineage Release ability for the cost of the written ability; only the effect of the ability of the card banished will be put onto the Effects Stack awaiting resolution. 

3. These abilities can only be activated if the card with Lineage Release is in the Inner Lineage \(i.e. it is not the player’s champion\). 

**Link**

1. Link is a static ability of objects that can confer type changes, value or stat modifications, or grant abilities to the Linked object. 

2. Objects that enter the field after resolution from the effects stack that specify a Link ability become linked to a targeted object, typically preceding the Link word. 

a. If an object with a Link ability were to enter the field from a zone other than the effects stack, the linked object is just chosen as the object enters the field. It will not target anything. 

b. If the activation or materialization of the card with the Link ability has no legal targets, it will fizzle. If the object with the Link ability enters the field from a zone other than the effects stack and has no legal choices to Link to, it will be sacrificed \(See points 6 and 7\). 

E.g. Champion Link, Ally Link. The target object of the Link is the Linked object \(and can be described as Linked ally, Linked champion, etc.\). 

3. Cards with Link abilities must specify the Link target when they are put onto the Effects Stack. If that object is no longer legal, it will fizzle. 

4. A Link ability is broken when either the object with the Link ability or the Linked object leaves the field. 

5. If the Link is destroyed as a result of the Linked object leaving the field in any way, the object with the Link ability is sacrificed as a state-based action \(players must sacrifice it before any Opportunity is passed and any further player actions are taken\). 

6. An object can be under the effect of any number of Link abilities. 

7. A Link only exists when at least one of the Linked objects has a legal Link. 

187

18/06/2025, 20:36

Grand Archive Comprehensive Rules v1.1.1

**Memory N\+**

1. Memory N\+ is a restriction ability that defines a bonus effect or replacement effect for a card that is enabled if and only if the player has N or more cards in their memory zone. 

**On Attack**

1. On Attack is a triggered ability condition. 

2. On units, On Attack means “When this unit attacks.” 

3. On cards in the intent and weapons, On Attack means "when this is used in an attack." 

**On Death**

1. On Death is a triggered ability condition that means “When this dies -” 

a. Only units can die. Non-units are still considered destroyed, but are not considered to have died. 

2. The unit is only considered to have died if it goes directly to the graveyard when it dies; On Death will not trigger if the unit is sent to banishment as a replacement for being sent to the graveyard. 

3. On Death triggers from the field and considers the source of the ability as the object that died, not the card itself that is placed in the graveyard. 

**On Enter**

1. On Enter is a triggered ability condition of objects that means “When this enters the field.” 

2. For champions, On Enter will consider the card entering the Lineage as the topmost champion card as if that card had entered the field \(it is not a new object\). 

**On Foster**

1. On Foster is a triggered ability condition which means “Whenever this unit becomes fostered.”

Grand Archive Comprehensive Rules v1.1.1

**On Hit**

1. On Hit is a triggered ability condition. 

2. On units, On Hit means “When this deals combat damage to an attackable object” 

a. On Hit will trigger off of hitting a Siegeable domain with damage dealt in the form of loss of durability counters from that domain. 

3. On intents and weapons, On Hit means “When an attack or retaliation using this deals combat damage to an attackble object” 

E.g. On Hit triggers on any unit being dealt combat damage, typically through attacks or retaliations. On Ally Hit triggers only when the combat damage is dealt to an ally unit. On Champion Hit triggers only when the combat damage is dealt to a champion unit. 

4. If an On Hit ability specifies an effect that specifies “that opponent” or

“that player,” this language will specify the opponent or player controlling the object that was hit. 

**On Kill**

1. On Kill is a triggered ability condition when attacked units are killed by an attack. 

a. Units are killed as a result of having 0 or less life as a state-based effect. 

b. Siegeable domains are destroyed as a result of having 0 or less durability as a state-based effect but will not trigger On Kill as they are not considered units. 

2. On units, On Kill means “When a unit is killed as a result of being dealt combat damage by this” 

3. On intents and weapons, On Kill means “When a unit is killed as a result of being dealt combat damage in an attack using this.” 

**On Leave**

1. On Leave is a triggered ability condition that means “When this leaves the field” 

2. On Leave triggers from the field and considers the source of the ability as the object that left play, not the card itself that is moved to another zone. 

189

18/06/2025, 20:36

Grand Archive Comprehensive Rules v1.1.1

**Prepare N**

1. Prepare is an optional cost-modifying static ability of some cards which means, “As an additional cost to activate \[CARDNAME\], you may remove N Preparation counters from your champion. If you do, \[CARDNAME\] becomes prepared as it’s activated.” 

2. If the Prepare cost was paid, the card becomes “prepared.” 

**Preserve/Preserved**

1. Preserve on objects means, “When \[CARDNAME\] is destroyed, put it into its owner’s material deck revealed and Preserved. You may return a Preserved card from your material deck to your hand instead of materializing when you would materialize.” 

Objects with Preserve will have a trigger when they are destroyed which will cause the object’s card to be sent from the graveyard to the material deck “Preserved.” 

2. Preserve on non-objects means, “As \[CARDNAME\] resolves and would be placed into the graveyard, instead put it into its owner’s material deck revealed and Preserved. You may return a Preserved card from your material deck to your hand instead of materializing when you would materialize.” Non-objects will have a replacement effect generated which will send the card to the material deck “Preserved” as it resolves rather than entering the graveyard. 

a. If a non-object card with Preserve would be banished instead of going to the graveyard as it resolves, the card’s controller may choose whether the card is Preserved or is banished. 

3. Every card that is Preserved is added to the material deck face-up and remains face-up until it moves to the hand, memory, or other zone considered as private information. 

4. “Preserved” is a card property that allows the card to be added back to a player’s hand when they would materialize instead of materializing a card. 

a. This will not count as a materialization. 

b. Preserved cards must stay revealed for as long as they remain Preserved. 

c. Returning a Preserved card to replace a materialization only requires that a player is given an opportunity to materialize, regardless of whether or not the player has a card they are able to materialize. 

i. "No Double Dipping": If a permission would be given to "play" a card, only the materialization choice would be able to be replaced and the player can't also activate a card while replacing the option to materialize.

Grand Archive Comprehensive Rules v1.1.1

**Pride N**

1. Pride is a static ability which means “This ally won’t obey you unless your champion is level N or higher.” \(Refer to Obedience. \) 2. If an object has multiple instances of pride, only the highest value is taken into consideration for obedience.

2. Multiple instances of Ranged stack additively. 

**Renewable**

1. Renewable is a static ability of Regalia which means “If this card would be banished from the field or an intent, put it into its owner’s material deck instead.” 

2. Renewable will not function from any other zones, such as the object-specific zone of loaded cards \(See Object-Specific Zones\). 

3. Renewable is redundant. 

**Reservable**

1. Reservable is a static ability of objects which means “while paying for a reserve cost, you may rest this object to pay for 1 of that cost.” 

2. Reservable can pay for any costs that require a reserve cost, including activation costs, added or extra reserve costs, or taxed reserve costs. 

3. Reservable is redundant.

191

18/06/2025, 20:36

Grand Archive Comprehensive Rules v1.1.1

**Spellshroud**

1. Spellshroud is a static ability of objects which means “This can’t be targeted by Spells.” 

where Spells are cards, effects, or sources that have or are granted the Spell subtype. 

a. Triggers generated by a Spell object are themselves of the Spell subtype and therefore cannot target objects with Spellshroud. 

2. Spellshroud is redundant. 

**Starcalling**

1. Starcalling is a static ability of cards which means “As you’re looking at this card while glimpsing, you may activate it by paying this cost. If you do, put all other cards you’re looking at on the bottom of your deck in any order.” 

a. Activating a card this way can ignore the default play speed. 

2. Starcalling is an alternative cost for activating cards, 3. When a player activates a card using the Starcalling cost, that player will put all other cards seen while glimpsing at the bottom of the deck in any order; they may not choose to put any cards on the top of the deck. 

4. Starcalling costs can still be modified by activation cost modifiers. 

5. Starcalling only functions from the Main Deck and cards activated by paying for Starcalling costs are considered as activated from the Main Deck and no other zones. 

6. Once a card is activated via Starcalling, it will be placed onto the effects stack but will not begin to resolve until any and all currently resolving effects are fully resolved. 

**Steadfast**

1. Steadfast is a static ability which means “This ally can retaliate while rested and doesn’t rest to do so.” 

2. Steadfast is redundant. 

**Stealth**

1. Stealth is a static ability of units which means "This object can't be targeted by attacks unless permitted by True Sight." 

192

18/06/2025, 20:36

Grand Archive Comprehensive Rules v1.1.1

2. Objects that were declared as retaliating against an attack before receiving stealth will still retaliate against their retaliation target and will deal damage accordingly during the combat phase. 

3. If an object receives stealth while being the target of an attack, that target is considered illegal for the attack, and the attack is fizzled unless the attacking object has true sight. 

The defending object stops being a defending object and the attacking unit stops being an attacking object. 

4. Stealth is redundant. 

**Taunt**

1. Taunt is a static ability. 

2. When declaring target\(s\) for an attack, a player must target awake units with Taunt over other attackable objects, if able. 

3. If multiple objects with Taunt are in play, the attacking player can choose which of those units to attack. 

4. Taunt is redundant. An object with Taunt and Taunt does not have to be attacked with higher priority over an object with a single instance of Taunt. 

**True Sight**

1. True Sight is a static ability. 

a. On units, True Sight means "This unit's attacks can target objects with stealth." 

b. On weapons, True Sight means "Attacks using this weapon can target objects with stealth." 

2. True Sight is redundant. 

**Unblockable**

1. Unblockable is a static ability which means "This unit's attacks can't be intercepted and ignore taunt."

Grand Archive Comprehensive Rules v1.1.1

**Game Terms**

**Activate/Activating**

1. To activate a card is to take the card from the zone it is currently in \(usually the hand\), pay its costs, and put it onto the Effects Stacks for resolution. A player may activate a card if they have Opportunity and are legally allowed to activate the card. 

2. To activate an ability is to indicate the ability being activated, pay the costs, and put the ability onto the Effects Stack for resolution. A player may activate a given ability if they have Opportunity and are legally allowed to activate the ability. 

**Awake**

1. A card on the field is considered awake if it is in an upright position. 

2. Abilities of that card that require resting such as attacking or as a cost of activation can only be activated if that card is awake. 

3. Cards enter the field awake. 

**Banish**

1. To banish a card is to take a card from the zone it is currently in and put that card in its owner’s Banishment zone. 

2. A banished card is a card that has been put into the Banishment zone. 

3. An object banished is not considered to have been destroyed or to have died when leaving the field this way. 

**Buff Counters**

1. Buff counters increase an object’s power and life stats by \+1 for each buff counter on that object. 

2. Stat modifications due to buff counters are static. 

**Control and Ownership**

195

18/06/2025, 20:36

Grand Archive Comprehensive Rules v1.1.1

1. Control of an object or card activation is given to the player who activated the corresponding card by default. 

2. The player that controls a specified object is referred to as that object’s controller. 

3. If control of a card, object, effect, or ability is not specified, control defaults to the owner. E.g. If an ally is suppressed,  the new object ally will be under the control of the owner of that ally card. 

4. If a triggered ability is placed onto the Effects Stack from a card or object, control of that ability is granted to the controller of that card or object as the ability was placed onto the Effects Stack; changes in control of that object will not retroactively change the player in control of that ability. 

5. The owner of the card does not necessarily always control the card. 

6. Ownership of a card \(within a game of Grand Archive\) is designated to the player that began the game with that card in their main deck, material deck, or sideboard. 

7. The player that owns a specified card is referred to as the owner of that card. 

8. Change in control does not change ownership of the card. 

**Copy**

1. Copy can refer to both the effect of copying an object or card activation or the copied object or card. 

2. When an object is copied, the copy object becomes a clone of the printed face of the card disregarding any modifiers such as extra counters or status conditions \(awake/rested, will not wake up, etc\). 

3. When a card activation is copied, the copy activation becomes a copy of the card in the Effects Stacks with all modes, activation choices, and otherwise modified activation attributes being identical to the original. 

4. If an effect is copied, it is effectively put onto the Effects Stack a second time with any relevant modes or activation choices and parameters copied from the original. 

**Damage Counters**

1. Damage counters are marked on champions to track a champion’s life. 

2. Counters can tick upwards from 0 and a champion is considered defeated when the damage counters reach or exceed the life stat of the champion. 

3. Damage counters can be removed by effects that recover. 

196

18/06/2025, 20:36

Grand Archive Comprehensive Rules v1.1.1

**Destruction**

1. Destroy is an effect that can affect any object\(s\) on the field. 

2. To destroy an object, move that object from the field to its owner’s Graveyard. If that card is a token, it will be removed from the game. 

a. Destroyed units are considered as having died when they go to the graveyard. They are not considered to have died if they would be banished, put on top/bottom of the deck, or put into the hand, instead. 

3. An object is destroyed if and only if it is specified to have been destroyed by an effect that specifies to destroy it, if it is destroyed as a result of state-based effects, or if it has been sacrificed. Cards entering the graveyard or being placed into the graveyard for any other reason does not mean it has been destroyed. 

4. A non-regalia weapon is considered destroyed as a result of state-based effects if the number of durability counters on that weapon is 0, either by combat or other means. 

5. A unit is destroyed from the state-based effect of having 0 or less life or from having damage marked \(temporary or via damage counters\) equal to or greater than its life. 

6. A siegeable domains is destroyed from the state-based effect of the number of durability counters on it reaching 0. 

7. An effect or card that specifies an object to be destroyed only causes that object to die if and only if that card immediately enters the graveyard upon resolution of effects. 

Banishment as a result of a destruction effect does not allow effects dependent upon that object dying or being sent to the graveyard to happen as there is not a time during the game in which that card can be considered to have entered the graveyard. 

**Died/Dies and Kills/Killed**

1. Dies is a term used to denote when a unit on the field would enter the graveyard. Units on the field die when they are either destroyed directly by a sourced effect \(e.g. tied to an object\) or by state-based effects, such as having 0 or less life. 

a. A sacrificed unit is considered to have died and been destroyed. 

b. Non-units do not die but they are still considered destroyed and can be killed. 

197

18/06/2025, 20:36

Grand Archive Comprehensive Rules v1.1.1

E.g., A destruction or destroy effect kills an ally and that ally is considered to have died. A siegeable domain being destroyed as a result of falling to 0 durability counters does not die. 

This means effects like On Kill will not trigger when it comes to non-units. 

2. An unit is only considered to have died or to have been killed if and only if it enters the graveyard directly from play. 

If it would be banished instead of being sent to the graveyard, the card is, by definition, not considered to have died. 

**Discard**

1. When a player discards a card, they must move a card from the specified zone to their Graveyard. If no zone is specified, cards are discarded from hand by default. 

2. Discarding a card can be required as an additional or alternative cost to playing a card or activating an ability. As with the normal steps in paying costs, discarding must be done before the card or ability is fully played or activated. 

3. Generally, effects that cause players to discard or require discarding as a cost allow them to choose which card or cards are discarded. Some effects may require that discarding is done randomly. 

**Distant**

1. Distant is a property of units. 

2. After a unit becomes distant, it will stay distant until the end of its controller’s turn. 

3. The distant property ends at the same time as other end of turn effects. 

**Durability Counters**

1. Weapons have durability counters that represent how many times they may be used to attack. 

2. Durability counters can be added to exceed the durability stat of a weapon. 

3. Weapons are destroyed when durability reaches 0. 

198

18/06/2025, 20:36

Grand Archive Comprehensive Rules v1.1.1

**Element**

1. The element of a card is represented by a name and symbol on the top right of its card face. 

2. Elements apply a restriction on players from playing cards unless that element is within the element identity of one of their champions. 

3. Elements fall under three categories: Norm, Basic, and Advanced. 

a. Norm is a default element without any restrictions; players always have access to playing cards of this element. 

b. Basic elements are Water, Fire, and Wind, and are typically unlocked by the Level 0 

champion that is put into play during the start of a game. Other effects can enable these elements, as well. 

c. Advanced elements are any elements that do not fall under either Norm or the Basic element categories. These elements are typically unlocked either after a champion reaches level 3 in its lineage or under special circumstances. 

**Enlighten Counters**

1. Enlighten counters confer the following ability to champions: “Remove 3 enlighten counters from \[CARDNAME\]: Draw a card.” 

2. Enlighten counters persist through level-ups of a player’s champion. 

**Fast**

1. Fast is an attribute of action cards that determines when that card may be activated. 

See the section on timing for further detail. 

2. Player actions or cards with the fast modifier may be activated while that player has Opportunity to act or during that player’s main phase if they are the turn player. 

**Fizzle**

1. Fizzle can refer to cards or abilities failing to resolve as a result of a game state where targets or game conditions made the activation illegal and the card or effect will not resolve. 

2. A card or ability that has fizzled is not considered to have been negated. 

199

18/06/2025, 20:36

Grand Archive Comprehensive Rules v1.1.1

**Fostered**

1. Fostered is a property of allies. 

2. Units are unfostered by default. 

3. Allies can be made to be fostered by other cards or as a state-based check generated by the Foster keyword ability. 

4. An ally can only become fostered once. 

**Gather**

1. Gather defines the player action of gathering. 

2. To gather, a player selects an ingredient at random from among six different token items and summons it. The six ingredients are Blightroot, Fraysia, Manaroot, Razorvine, Silvershine, and Springleaf. Each ingredient has two characteristic subtypes used in conjunction with the Brew ability: Adjuvants or Catalysts, and Root, Leaf, or Flower. 

3. If a player uses the gather token board, they may use dice or other counting tokens to denote the quantities of each ingredient. Each is still considered an individual object on the field and can be interacted with normally. 

**Generate**

1. Generate defines the player action of generating cards, or adding cards from outside the game permanently for the remainder of a game of Grand Archive. Generated cards do not persist after the conclusion of a game; any generated cards will be removed from the play area and corresponding zones after a game has ended. 

2. Generating a card adds the specified generated card to the effect’s controller’s hand by default. If a zone is specified for the generate effect, the card will be added in the specified zone for the duration of the game. If that zone is no longer present, it will regress to the default case of being added to the hand. 

3. Generated cards can exceed the quantity limits imposed by deckbuilding constraints. 

4. Players must own physical copies of each of the cards they wish to generate in a game. 

5. If a player attempts to generate a card but does not have the physical card to represent the generated card, the card generation fails; the player fails to generate the card. 

6. Cards are added to the hand by default if no zone is specified or a zone that it would be placed into does not exist when a player would be instructed to put a generated card 200

18/06/2025, 20:36

Grand Archive Comprehensive Rules v1.1.1

there. 

**Glimpse**

1. Glimpse defines the player action of glimpsing, usually worded as glimpse N. 

2. To Glimpse N, a player looks at the top N cards of their deck and places any number of those cards to the top of their deck in any order and the remainder on the bottom of their deck in any order. 

**Have, Gain, Get, Become/Are**

1. Have and Gain: Have/Has and Gain/Gains are used when an effect grants an ability or an effect to a set of described cards or objects\) This effect is static for all cards or objects within the set that fit the described criteria. This will extend to any cards or objects that can be added to the described set of cards after the effect initially begins. If a card or object did not have the granted ability or effect before, it is considered to have gained it. Have does not specify a specific time when that characteristic was granted while gain confers an ability at a specific point in time. 

2. Get: Get and Gets is used when an effect grants a stat modification to a set of described cards or objects. This effect is applied statically to all cards or objects within the set that fit the described criteria under the effect and lasts as long as the continuous effect persists. For one-shot effects,  this effect only considered the set present when the effect was resolved. Otherwise, conditionally static effects that use words like "as long as \[condition\]" apply the effect only if the condition is fulfilled. 

3. Become: Become and Are are used when an effect specifies a change of characteristics, such as typing, or properties to a set of cards or objects. All cards or objects within the described set become or are set to a property statically. Becomes is used for setting a property to a given state at a certain time while are sets the default property of the described cards/objects to that mode, but without a specific starting point. 

a. A state of a property is only considered changed if the state before and after a property for a card or object are different. If a card or object in a given state becomes the same state or is/are the same state, it will not be considered as a change of state. 

**Hit**

1. Hit will typically be considered in relation to On Hit triggered abilities. 

201

18/06/2025, 20:36

Grand Archive Comprehensive Rules v1.1.1

2. A unit is hit when it is dealt damage through an attack. 

3. If no damage is dealt or damage dealt is zero, a unit is not considered hit. 

4. Non-Combat damage sources will not cause the unit to be considered hit. 

**Influence**

1. A player’s influence is equal to the total number of cards in their hand and memory zones. 

**Label Keywords**

1. Label keywords exist as bolded and italicized text followed by a long hyphen on cards that does not function as a normal keyword. Rather, they will refer to a broad class of similar mechanics with individual cards differing in the wording or conditions of the keyword. 

2. Label keywords can be referenced by abilities or effects and do count as a characteristic of the card. 

3. List of Label keywords:

• Balance: This keyword represents that a card will offer additional effects based on whether the player has an equal amount of cards in their hand and memory. 

• Deluge N: This keyword represents a static ability around the condition of having N or more water cards in the graveyard. 

• Harmonize: This keyword represents that a card will offer additional effects based on whether a Melody subclass card was activated previously during this turn during the resolution of the card. 

• Upkeep: This keyword presents a cost or condition that must be fulfilled each turn, usually with the adverse effect of not fulfilling the upkeep condition. 

• Equestrian: This keyword reflects abilities that function in conjunction with controlling a Horse ally. The Horse ally may have any typing so long as "Horse" exists as a subtype and "Ally" exists as a type. 

**Last-known Information**

202

18/06/2025, 20:36

Grand Archive Comprehensive Rules v1.1.1

1. Last–known information is information such as status, characteristics, or stats of an object or card that is tracked when that card changes zones. 

2. Some effects are reliant on information while a card or object was in a specific zone and will use the information as if that card was still in that zone for determination of effects. 

3. Last-known information only considers the last zone change that happened and not any information carried from zone changes prior to that. 

**Leave/Leaves**

1. These are interchangeable terms used to denote when a non-Champion object on the field would leave the field and move to another zone. 

**Level \(base\)**

1. The base level of a champion is the printed level of the champion card in the top left corner. This level determines the leveling sequence of a champion and does not include any level stat modifiers such as “your champion gets \+X levels.” The base level is a static characteristic of the champion card. The base level is typically only considered for leveling up champions rather than meeting level restrictions for abilities and effects. 

**Level Counters**

1. Level counters represent \+1 LV for each level counter on the champion. 

2. These counters do not modify the base level of the champion. 

**Level Up**

1. A level up or the act of leveling up is when a player adds the next level champion onto one of the champion’s lineages. This does not use the effects stack. Leveling up will cause any “On Enter” abilities of the card being placed onto the lineage to trigger. 

2. Leveling up itself is not considered a materialization but can be the result of materializing a champion card. 

3. Leveling up is not based on any level modifications from other effects in the game and is solely based on the printed \(base\) level of the champion card. 

203

18/06/2025, 20:36

Grand Archive Comprehensive Rules v1.1.1

**Lineage \(term\)**

1. A lineage is the entire group of cards dedicated to representing a champion. A lineage includes all cards including the inner lineage as well as the topmost card \(i.e. the representative champion\). 

2. The name of a lineage follows the name \(excluding titles or monikers\) of the topmost card and any leveling restrictions or champion restriction abilities will use that name as a basis. 

**Loaded**

1. Loaded is a property of objects. 

2. Cards are unloaded by default. 

3. Cards are considered loaded when an object has cards in its Loaded Cards zone. 

**LV**

1. LV refers to the level of your champion as a sum of the level denoted on your champion card in addition to level modifying effects in the game. 

2. LV is generally used for effects or rules text requiring a calculation or a referential variable. 

3. LV can take on negative values. If being used to calculate cost reductions \(such as with Efficiency\), a negative LV value will increase costs. When being used to count or select cards, counters, or objects, a negative LV is considered 0 \(you can't select negative amounts of cards or objects\). 

**Modes**

1. Modes are effects that are listed on a card that require a player to make a choice as to which of the effects would take place if a card or effect were to resolve. These choices are made before a card is placed onto the Effects Stack pending resolution. Cards and abilities with these modes can be called modal. 

**Negate**

204



18/06/2025, 20:36

Grand Archive Comprehensive Rules v1.1.1

1. Some effects may specify to negate a certain card, game action, or effect. 

2. If something is negated, it is immediately removed from the effects stack and does not resolve \(it does not happen\) and any effects that would otherwise have occurred as a result of the resolution of the negated card/action/effect do not occur. 

3. Any triggers dependent upon activation of the negated card still occur. 

4. Paid costs are not refunded when something is negated. 

5. If a card is negated, the default zone for negated cards to be sent is the graveyard. 

However, if the card had rules text to modify where that card would have gone during resolution, or the destination zone were changed due to a replacement effect or other ability, the destination zone is carried over during its negation and it will not go to the graveyard. This is also true for rules set by supertypes such as Regalia. 

A negated Crux sight for which the additional 2 was paid will cause it to be banished as it is negated. Additionally, negated Regalia objects will be banished as a result of the Regalia supertype modifying where they would be placed. 

**Obedience**

205

18/06/2025, 20:36

Grand Archive Comprehensive Rules v1.1.1

1. A player can’t attack with or activate the abilities of an ally that does not obey that player. They may still have that ally retaliate. 

2. Allies obey their controlling players by default. 

3. Static abilities and triggered abilities of an ally will always happen regardless of obedience, but ownership of the abilities depends on the control of that ally. Some abilities may require obedience of the source object to resolve properly. 

4. An attacking ally will continue performing the attack even after it no longer obeys the player who originally declared the attack. This is included when pride conditions are suddenly not fulfilled or if control of the object changes during an attack. 

**Opportunity**

1. Opportunity is defined as the time in which a player has the chance to act in response to player actions taken by either themselves or by another player, in response to an effect or player action pending resolution, or in response to a phase change. 

2. When Opportunity arises, it first is given to the turn player and proceeds to other players in turn order. 

3. Phases apart from the main phase end according to when no players have Opportunity and no events are pending resolution. 

**Play/Played**

1. A card is considered played after it is either materialized or activated. 

2. Materializing or activating a card counts as playing the card. 

**Player Action**

1. Player actions are distinct actions in the game a player can take. E.g. activating or materializing cards, attacking, activating abilities, etc. 

2. Player action order is the order in which players may take actions during a turn when they would receive Opportunity. After a player action is taken or Opportunity is granted, it is first given to the turn player. The turn player may act first, after which non-turn players may each take a turn performing player actions as allowed by the game. 

This can be called the Turn Player / Non-turn Player order. 

206

18/06/2025, 20:36

Grand Archive Comprehensive Rules v1.1.1

**Players**

1. A player is an individual taking part in a game of Grand Archive. The “turn player” is the player in control of the current turn and its progression and “non-turn players” are any players that are not the turn player. 

**Preparation Counters**

1. Preparation counters are a type of counter that may be placed on a champion. 

2. Preparation counters may be paid as an additional cost when activating a card with the keyword Prepare

**Recover**

1. Recover defines the player action of recovering damage, usually worded as recover N. 

2. To recover N, a player removes N damage counters from their champion. 

a. If a player attempts to recover more than the number of damage counters on their champion, they instead remove all damage counters from the champion. 

b. A player can’t remove more than the number of damage counters present on a champion, e.g. if a champion has two damage counters and the player recovers 3, only 2 damage counters are removed. 

E.g. For a card that says, "As an additional cost to activate this card, Recover 10," a player activating that card must have a champion with at least 10 damage counters that must be removed." 

**Redirect**

1. Redirect means to change the target of a card or ability to another valid target. 

2. If an effect specified to choose rather than to target, it cannot be redirected.

Grand Archive Comprehensive Rules v1.1.1

1. A reflexive trigger is a trigger found within an effect or ability that is placed onto the effects stack only if the condition for that trigger is fulfilled and after the initial part of the ability or effect is fully resolved. 

2. The source of a reflexive trigger is considered the original source of the effect or ability that generated the reflexive trigger. 

E.g. Umbra Sight optionally allows a player to draw a card into their memory and put Umbra Sight on the bottom of their champion's lineage. The remainder of the text from "When you do,. ." is a reflexive trigger; It is a triggered ability that is put onto the effects stack after Umbra Sight resolves and the second card is optionally drawn with Umbra Sight put on the bottom of the champion's lineage. 

**Reserve**

1. Reserve refers to the player action of taking a card from their hand and placing it into their Memory zone. 

2. Reserved cards are returned to the player's hand during the Recollection phase.

Grand Archive Comprehensive Rules v1.1.1

1. To rest an object on the field, that object is turned from the upright \(awake\) orientation to the horizontal \(rested\) orientation. 

2. Rest Symbol: The rest symbol will appear on a card as a black-bordered arrow turning 180 degrees to the right. 

3. The rest symbol will usually indicate resting as a cost for activating an ability. 

4. An object on the field is considered rested if it is in a horizontal orientation. 

5. Objects that are already rested can’t rest; players cannot rest objects that are rested. If an effect attempts to rest an object that is rested, nothing will happen. 

**Retaliate/Retaliation**

1. To retaliate, the defending player may rest a defending unit during the retaliation step of the combat phase to represent it as retaliating during combat. 

2. Resting is a cost to retaliate; already-rested units cannot retaliate. 

3. A retaliating unit will deal damage according to its power against the attacking unit during the damage step. 

4. When retaliation is declared, the retaliating unit causes the attacking unit to become the retaliation target, which is maintained even if the attacking unit stops attacking during the combat phase. 

5. Units without a power stat or have a power of 0 cannot retaliate. 

6. Retaliation is the act of a defending unit resting in order to deal damage according to its power against a unit attacking it. 

7. A unit can only retaliate if it was an object on the field “before retaliation.” \(See Retaliation Step of combat.\)

8. A unit that gains stealth after being declared as retaliating during the combat phase will still retaliate against its attacker during the damage step and deal damage accordingly. 

**Reveal**

1. An ability, effect, or game rule may tell a player to reveal a card or a group of cards in a game zone. 

2. To reveal a card, a player takes the specified card\(s\) in that zone and presents them to all players in the game face-up as public information. 

209

18/06/2025, 20:36

Grand Archive Comprehensive Rules v1.1.1

3. Cards remain revealed until the next discrete game state/until a player takes a player action, or until the next time state-based effects are checked. 

4. Revealed cards may be written down or recorded however a player wishes to do so but may not ask that the revealed cards stay revealed; the information state of the revealed card \(private vs public\) reverts to the original state before it was revealed after the card stops being revealed. 

5. Cards revealed from a private zone ought to be shuffled or randomized among the other cards in the zone after those cards stop being revealed. 

6. A card that is already public information or already known can be revealed any number of times. 

**Sacrifice**

1. Sacrificing an object is a player action. 

2. To sacrifice means to remove an object from the field or in play and put it into the graveyard, or, if the object was a regalia or champion, into banishment. 

a. The type of object to be sacrificed will be characterized by the effect or cost. 

b. If an object is sacrificed as a cost to pay for an effect, ability, or activation, that object is sacrificed at the same time all other costs are paid. 

c. Players can only sacrifice objects they control. 

d. An object is still considered sacrificed if a replacement effect would cause the object to go to a zone other than the graveyard. 

3. If the object has an On Death trigger or would trigger an ability due to that object being sacrificed in order to activate a card or ability, the ability will be placed onto the Effects Stack on top of that card or ability and resolved first. 

4. If the object has an On Death trigger or would trigger an ability due to that object being sacrificed as a result of an effect, the ability will be placed onto the Effects Stack after all effects of the original ability specifying the sacrifice have resolved. 

**Search**

1. Search is an instructional word in some effects that tell a player to look through a set of cards in a zone, typically with the intended result of choosing one or more cards out of that set to perform an action on them, such as moving them to another zone.

**Shuffling**

1. Shuffling a set of cards is to make that set of cards sufficiently randomized such that any player in a game cannot uniquely identify any one card and has no reasonable knowledge as to the location of any of those cards from among the set. 

2. Effects may instruct a player or players to shuffle a set of card. If this is done, those players must take the specified cards or set of cards and mix them in a random manner suitable for them until those cards are sufficiently randomized. 

**Slow**

1. Slow is an attribute of action cards that determines when that card may be activated. 

See the section on timing for further detail. 

2. Attacks and ally cards innately have a slow timing modifier, only being able to be activated by the turn player during their main phase when no effects are on the Effects Stack. 

**Source**

1. A source is considered the object or card from which damage, ability, or effect originates. 

**Suppress**

1. Suppress is a keyworded action that can target an object which means for its controlling player to “banish it and return it to the field under its owner’s control at the beginning of the next end phase.” The return of the object is caused by a delayed trigger created by Suppress. 

2. If a card banished with suppress were to leave banishment before the delayed trigger were to resolve, the delayed trigger will not return that card to the field from wherever it currently is; the card in banishment must be the same card that was initially banished. 

**Summon**

1. Summon defines the player action of summoning objects into play. 

211

18/06/2025, 20:36

Grand Archive Comprehensive Rules v1.1.1

2. A summoned object is treated as a token that only exists while it is on the field. 

3. Summoned objects \(tokens\) can be represented by any outside game object such that it is easy to distinguish tokens apart from other objects and such that the characteristics of that token is easily tracked or referenceable. 

**Timestamp**

1. A timestamp is a chronological marker tied to an object on the field placed when it entered play or tied to a continuous effect when it began in the game. Timestamps are used to keep track of recency of effects and to determine which effects would supersede another if they modify the same value\(s\). 

2. Effects with timestamps are applied in order of oldest effects to newest effects. 

**Token**

1. A token is an object put into play through an effect instructing a player to summon that object. 

2. Tokens are treated as regular objects while in play but will cease to exist when they move to another zone. 

3. A token moving to another zone will still complete any state-based checks, triggers, and any necessary actions to resolve the game state, and the token will cease to exist as Opportunity is passed to the next player. 

**Transform**

1. Transform defines the player action of flipping a double-faced card \(as an object\) over to its other face. Only card that have valid side to transform into may transform. 

a. If a player attempts to transform a card that cannot be transformed, nothing will happen. This includes any attempts at having a card enter the field transformed if the card is not a double-faced card. 

2. Transforming a card will retain any counters that were initially placed on the object. It will also retain any applied continuous effects, such as Links, if legal. 

**Unit**

212

18/06/2025, 20:36

Grand Archive Comprehensive Rules v1.1.1

1. Units are champions and ally objects. 

2. Units can typically be attack targets during attack declarations. 

**Wake Up**

1. To wake up an object on the field, that object is turned from the horizontal \(rested\) orientation to the upright \(awake\) orientation. 

2. Objects that are already awake can’t wake up; players cannot wake up objects that are awake. If an effect attempts to wake up an object that is awake, nothing will happen.
