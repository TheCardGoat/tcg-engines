// **7.6. Static Abilities**

// **7.6.1. **Static abilities are effects that could alter characteristics of a card, game rule, or game state. These are continuously active for the stated length of time. A static ability that doesn’t specify a duration is continuously active for as long as the card generating the effect is in play.

// ***Example:** An ability that reads “Your exerted characters gain Ward until end of turn” and an ability that reads “Your exerted* *characters gain Ward” are both static abilities. *

// **7.6.2. **Cards played that would be affected by a static ability have that effect as they come into play. If this modifies their \{S\} or \{W\}

// they are considered to enter play with that adjusted \{S\} or \{W\}.

// **7.6.3. **Some static abilities occur as the result of a resolving ability or effect. Once resolved, the static ability continues to apply to the affected cards for the specified duration. Cards that would be affected by a static ability but entered play after the ability or effect is resolved aren’t affected by the static effect.

// **7.6.4. **Some static abilities are part of the characteristics of a card. These static abilities remain “on” as long as the card generating the effect is in play. If a card generating a static ability leaves play, the effect ends as soon as the card is removed from the Play zone. There’s no point at which an affected card will still have the ability and then lose it.

// **7.6.5. **Some static effects apply outside of the Play zone. These specify the aspect and time they apply to.

// ***Example:** An effect that reads “For each character card in your discard, you pay 1 *\{I\} * less to play this character” would apply* *outside of play. *
