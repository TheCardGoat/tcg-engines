        //
        //       **7.1. General**
        //
        //       **7.1.1. **Each clause of a card is a separate effect and/or cost. Each clause is separated by a period.
        //
        //         **7.1.2. **Cards that list one or more costs or effects in a single clause resolve based on the intervening word.
        //
        //         **7.1.2.1. **Most cards are written as \[A\].
        //
        //       ***Example:** "You may have up to 99 copies of Dalmatian Puppy – Tail Wagger in your deck." *
        //
        //       **7.1.2.2. **\[A\] to \[B\] – The player must pay the cost described in the first part of the clause \[A\]. If they're unable to do that, they can't finish resolving the effect in the second part of the clause \[B\]. The first part of the clause \[A\] is a cost, not an effect. The second part of the clause \[B\] is an effect. ** **
        //
        //         ***Example:** "Banish chosen item of yours to deal 5 damage to chosen character." If the player doesn't have an item* *in play that they can banish to pay the cost listed in the first part of the clause \[A\], they can't deal the 5 damage* *described in the second part of the clause \[B\]. *
        //
        //       **7.1.2.3. **\[A\] then \[B\] – Resolve all effects as much as possible, even if some of the effects can't be resolved.
        //
        //         ***Example:** "Draw 2 cards, then choose and discard 2 cards." *
        //
        //       **7.1.2.4. **\[A\] and \[B\] – Resolve all effects as much as possible, even if some of the effects can't be resolved or "and" seems to tie the effects together as though the wording were \[A\] to \[B\]. Sometimes "and" simply serves its normal grammatical purpose.
        //
        //         ***Example A:** The Queen – Commanding Presence's ability Who is the Fairest? reads, "Whenever this character quests,* *chosen opposing character gets -4 *\{S\} * this turn and chosen character gets \+4 *\{S\} * this turn." If the opponent doesn't* *have a character in play that can be chosen for the first part of this effect, the active player still gives a chosen* *character \+4 *\{S\} *. *
        //
        //       ***Example B:** John Silver – Greedy Treasure Seeker's ability Chart Your Own Course reads, "For each location you have in* *play, this character gains **Resist** \+1 and gets \+1 *\{L\} *. This "and" doesn't have any special gameplay significance. *
        //
        //         **7.1.3. **If an ability or effect contains the word "may," the player who played the card that generated the effect can choose whether they want it to happen. If the player chooses not to have it happen, no part of the "you may" clause is performed.
        //
        //         **7.1.4. **If an ability or effect "puts a card into your hand" from any other zone, that is not considered drawing a card.
        //
        //         **7.1.5. **If an ability or effect refers to "another" or "other," it refers to a card that any card that effect or ability does not originate from, or one that was not already selected by the ability.
        //
        //         ***Example:** Mulan – Imperial Soldier reads, "During your turn, whenever this character banishes another character in a challenge,* *your other characters get \+1 *\{L\} * this turn." Mulan must banish a character that is not herself, and she doesn't gain the benefit of* *this ability herself because it only applies to your "other" characters. *
        //
        //         **7.1.6. **If an ability or effect instructs you to play a card as a part of resolving that ability, you must resolve the ability before playing the card. If the instruction is fol owed by additional steps for resolving the ability, the card doesn't resolve or come into play until the ability is ful y resolved, even if it's moved to a different zone.
        //
        //       ***Example:** The active player has an Ursula – Deceiver of All in play and exerts her to sing Friends on the Other Side. Ursula's* *ability What a Deal reads, "Whenever this character sings a song, you may play that song again from your discard for free. If you* *do, put that card on the bottom of your deck instead of into your discard. Once the song has finished resolving, the player can* *resolve the triggered ability, which al ows them to play Friends on the Other Side again. If they choose to do so, the effect of the* *song card waits to resolve until Ursula's triggered ability is resolved ful y. Once Friends on the Other Side is put on the bottom of* *the active player's deck, then the player draws 2 cards. *
        //
        //         **7.1.7. **Sometimes a combination of abilities can be repeated indefinitely, cal ed a "loop." If all players are aware of and understand the actions of each iteration of the loop, the player who maintains the loop proposes a specific number of iterations. The game is considered to proceed immediately through those iterations without the player performing each one. Then the game continues and a new action must be taken.
        //
        //         **7.1.8. **If resolving an effect al ows a player to choose "up to" N of something, the player can't pick the same choice for each iteration of N. "Up to" includes 0 as a legal choice.
        //
        //         ***Example:** The song Painting the Roses Red reads, "Up to 2 chosen characters get -1 *\{S\} * this turn. Draw a card." The same* *character can't be chosen twice. The card's player could also choose 0 characters. *
        //
        //         **7.1.9. **Some abilities and effects use "that" in their text to refer to a specific game term. When resolving abilities and effects, the determination of what "that \[Game Term\]" refers to occurs after choices are made as the ability or effect is resolving (see 1.2.4).
        //
        //       ***Example A:** Ursula – Deceiver of Al 's ability What a Deal reads, "Whenever this character sings a song, you may play that song* *again from your discard for free. If you do, put that card on the bottom of your deck instead of into your discard. Here, "that* *song" refers to the card sung by Ursula and not to any other song card that is in your discard pile. *
        //
        //         ***Example B:** Yzma – Above It All has the ability Back to Work, which reads, "Whenever another character is banished in a* *chal enge, return that card to its player's hand, then that player discards a card at random." As the effect resolves, Yzma's player* *first determines that there are no choices to be made. Then, they determine "that card" is the character banished in a chal enge* *and "that player" is the player whose character is banished. These determinations are made as the effect resolves. *
        //
        //         **7.1.9.1. **If card text references a specific zone where "that" card is put or located, only that zone is checked. If the card referenced by "that" has changed zones, the part of the effect checking the zone for "that" card fails and resolves with no effect, even if there are other cards whose full name matches the full name of "that" card. The player does as much they can when resolving the rest of the effect.
        //
        //         ***Example:** A player has 2 copies of Ursula – Deceiver of All in play and exerts them both to sing a song using its **Sing ***
        //
        //       ***Together** ability. Ursula's ability What a Deal reads, "Whenever this character sings a song, you may play that song* *again from your discard for free. If you do, put that card on the bottom of your deck instead of into your discard. *
        //
        //       *Because both copies of Ursula were exerted to sing together, both of their What a Deal abilities are triggered and* *added to the bag to be resolved. *
        //
        //         *When the first triggered ability resolves, the song card played using **Sing Together** is put on the bottom of the player's* *deck. When the second triggered ability resolves, "that song" card is no longer in the discard, so that part of the effect* *resolves with no effect. Similarly, "that song" doesn't refer to a specific song card anymore, so the latter part of the* *effect also does nothing. Even if there's another song card with the same name in the discard, "that song" refers only* *to the specific song card that was sung by Ursula when the triggered abilities were added to the bag, not any other* *song card with the same name. *
        //
        //         **7.1.10. **Some effects instruct the active player to reveal a card or cards. To reveal a card, the player shows the face of the card to all other players in the game. The player can reveal cards only from the group of cards described earlier in the effect.
        //
        //         ***Example:** The song Look at This Family has an effect that reads, "Look at the top 5 cards of your deck. You may reveal up to 2 *
        //
        //         *character cards and put them into your hand. Put the rest on the bottom of your deck in any order." The cards the player chooses* *to reveal can only come from the top 5 cards the player looked at. The player can't choose to reveal any cards from any other* *group of cards. *
        //
        //         **7.2. Action Cards**
        //
        //       **7.2.1. **Playing an action may trigger other abilities. In this case, the active player resolves the action immediately, and once that action has been ful y resolved, players may resolve the triggered abilities as described in section 8.7, "Bag."
        //
        //       **7.3. Keywords**
        //
        //       **7.3.1. **Keyword abilities are abilities represented by short names that are the same wherever the ability appears. See section 10,
        //
        // "Keywords," for more information on individual keyword abilities.
        //
        //         **7.3.2. **Keywords are usual y fol owed by reminder text describing what they do. This reminder text, enclosed in parentheses and set in italics, is not rules text but only a memory aid.
        //
        //         **7.4. Triggered Abilities**
        //
        //       **7.4.1. **Triggered abilities occur when their trigger condition is met. They trigger only once per trigger condition that is met.
        //
        //         **7.4.2. **Triggered abilities start with "When," "Whenever," "At the start of," or "At the end of" and describe the game state that causes the abilities to trigger and the effects of the abilities.
        //
        //         **7.4.3. **When an ability triggers, its effect is placed into the bag to be resolved in order as described in section 8.7, "Bag."
        //
        //       **7.4.4. **Some triggered abilities are written as "\[Trigger Condition\], if \[Secondary Condition\], \[Effect\]. These abilities check whether the secondary condition is true both when the effect would be added to the bag and again when the effect resolves.
        //
        //         **7.4.4.1. **If the secondary condition is false when the effect would be added to the bag, the effect is never added to the bag.
        //
        //         **7.4.4.2. **If the secondary condition is false when the effect would resolve, the triggered ability resolves with no effect.
        //
        //         ***Example:** Stitch – Carefree Surfer has an ability cal ed Ohana that reads, "When you play this character, if you have* *2 or more other characters in play, you may draw 2 cards." When the active player plays Stitch, the triggered ability* *checks to see if the player has two or more other characters in play. If not, the triggered ability isn't added to the bag. *
        //
        //         *If the player has two or more characters in play, the ability is added to the bag. The triggered ability will check again* *when it resolves to see if the condition is still true. If it isn't, the triggered ability resolves for no effect. *
        //
        //         **7.4.5. **Some triggered abilities are written as, "\[Trigger Condition\], \[Effect\]. \[Effect\]." Both effects are linked to the trigger condition but are independent of each other.
        //
        //         ***Example A:** Moana – Of Motunui has an ability cal ed We Can Fix It that reads, "Whenever this character quests, you may ready* *your other Princess characters. They can't quest for the rest of this turn." If the active player chooses to quest with Moana, none* *of their other Princess characters can quest this turn, regardless of whether they were readied by the effect or not. *
        //
        //         ***Example B:** Scar – Vicious Cheater has an ability cal ed Daddy Isn't Here to Save You that reads, "During your turn, whenever* *this character banishes another character in a chal enge, you may ready this character. He can't quest for the rest of this turn." *
        //
        //       *Because the two effects are both tied to the trigger condition, if Scar doesn't chal enge he can quest this turn as normal. *
        //
        //         **7.4.6. **Some triggered abilities are written as, "\[Trigger Condition\] and \[Trigger Condition\], \[Effect\]." These abilities function as having two triggered abilities that are independent of each other but both resolve for the same effect.
        //
        //         ***Example:** John Silver – Alien Pirate has an ability cal ed Pick Your Fights that reads, "When you play this character and whenever* *he quests, chosen opposing character gains **Reckless** during their next turn." The triggered ability occurs when John Silver is* *played and also when the active player quests with this character. The triggered ability doesn't need both trigger conditions to* *be true at the same time for it to occur, only one or the other. *
        //
        //         **7.4.7. **Some abilities and effects create a triggered ability that can occur only during a specific duration or when a specific condition is met at a particular moment later in the game. These are usual y created as the result of resolving an action card.
        //
        //         **7.4.7.1. ** *Floating Triggered Abilities –* Triggered abilities created to exist for a specified duration. These exist outside of the bag. Whenever the condition of the floating triggered ability is met, an instance of that triggered ability is added to the bag for resolution. Once that duration has expired, the floating triggered ability ceases to exist.
        //
        //         ***Example:** Steal from the Rich is an action that reads, "Whenever one of your characters quests this turn, each* *opponent loses 1 lore." When Steal from the Rich resolves, it creates the floating triggered ability defined by the card. *
        //
        //         *This exists for the rest of the turn. * *Whenever the player quests with one of their characters that turn, the condition* *of the floating triggered ability is met and an instance of that triggered ability is added to the bag to resolve. The* *floating triggered ability continues to exist outside of the bag until the end of the turn, when the specified duration in* *the condition expires. *
        //
        //         **7.4.7.2. ** *Delayed Triggered Abilities –* Triggered abilities created to resolve at a specific moment later in the game. This moment is specified in the condition of the delayed triggered ability. The ability exists outside of the bag until that condition is met. When the condition is met, the delayed triggered ability is added to the bag for resolution.

        //         **7.5. Activated Abilities**
        //
        //       **7.5.1. **Activated abilities are abilities that a player chooses to use. They are normal y written as \[Cost\] — \[Effect\].
        //
        //       **7.5.2. **While there are no effects waiting to resolve and a character isn't questing or in a chal enge, the active player may use an activated ability.
        //
        //         **7.5.3. **To use an activated ability, the active player fol ows these steps in order. If any part of this process can't be performed, it's il egal to use the ability. These steps apply to all activated abilities. Only the active player can use activated abilities.
        //
        //         **7.5.3.1. **First, the active player announces the ability they intend to use.
        //
        //         **7.5.3.2. **Second, the player fol ows the steps described in 4.3.4.4 through 4.3.4.6, replacing any instance of the word "card"
        //
        // with the word "ability."
        //
        //       **7.5.3.3. **Once the total cost is paid, the ability is activated. The active player resolves the effect immediately.

        //         **7.5.4. **If an effect would trigger as a result of any of the steps to using an activated ability, that effect waits to resolve until the ability is fully resolved.
        //
        //         **7.6. Static Abilities**
        //
        //       **7.6.1. **Static abilities are effects that could alter characteristics of a card, game rule, or game state. These are continuously active for the stated length of time. A static ability that doesn't specify a duration is continuously active for as long as the card generating the effect is in play.
        //
        //         ***Example:** An ability that reads "Your exerted characters gain Ward until end of turn" and an ability that reads "Your exerted* *characters gain Ward" are both static abilities. *
        //
        //         **7.6.2. **Cards played that would be affected by a static ability have that effect as they come into play. If this modifies their \{S\} or \{W\}
        //
        //         they are considered to enter play with that adjusted \{S\} or \{W\}.
        //
        //       **7.6.3. **Some static abilities occur as the result of a resolving ability or effect. Once resolved, the static ability continues to apply to the affected cards for the specified duration. Cards that would be affected by a static ability but entered play after the ability or effect is resolved aren't affected by the static effect.
        //
        //         **7.6.4. **Some static abilities are part of the characteristics of a card. These static abilities remain "on" as long as the card generating the effect is in play. If a card generating a static ability leaves play, the effect ends as soon as the card is removed from the Play zone. There's no point at which an affected card will still have the ability and then lose it.
        //
        //         **7.6.5. **Some static effects apply outside of the Play zone. These specify the aspect and time they apply to.
        //
        //         ***Example:** An effect that reads "For each character card in your discard, you pay 1 *\{I\} * less to play this character" would apply* *outside of play. *
        //
        //         **7.7. Replacement Effects**
        //
        //       **7.7.1. **Some effects are considered *replacement effects*. These effects wait for the stated condition to occur and then partial y or completely replace the event as the effect resolves.
        //
        //         **7.7.2. **Abilities that include the word "instead" are the most common type of replacement effect.
        //
        //         ***Example:** Stolen Scimitar's ability Slash reads, "*\{E\} * — Chosen character gets \+1 *\{S\} * this turn. If a character named Aladdin is* *chosen, he gets \+2 *\{S\} * instead." *
        //
        //       **7.7.3. **Abilities that include the word "skip" are replacement effects.
        //
        //         **7.7.4. **Abilities that include "enter" or "enters" are replacement effects.
        //
        //         **7.7.5. **Replacement effects happen once and need to exist before the event would occur. If an event is replaced, it never happens.
        //
        //             A modified event occurs, and the new event may trigger abilities. Abilities that would have triggered from the original event don't see it, and therefore they don't trigger.
        //
        //         **7.7.6. **Only one replacement effect can replace a specific effect. If there are multiple replacement effects for the same specific effect, the player who played the card that generated the effect being replaced chooses which effect replaces it.
        //
        //         **7.7.7. **An effect that skips a step or phase of the game is a replacement effect that replaces that step or phase with nothing. "Skip \[Step/
        //
        //         Phase\]" means the same as "If a player would perform the \[Step/Phase\], do nothing instead. If the effect skips a step or phase, no part of that step or phase happens. Any abilities or effects that would occur because of that step or phase don't happen.
        //
        //         ***Example:** Arthur – Determined Squire has an ability No More Books that reads, "Skip your turn's Draw step." When a player* *would start their Draw step with Arthur in play, they skip their Draw step instead and move immediately to the Main Phase* *of their turn. However, if a player finds a way to play Arthur during their Draw step, the current Draw step isn't skipped and* *proceeds normally. *
        //
        //         **7.8. Ability Modifiers**
        //
        //       **7.8.1. **Some abilities and effects can modify the characteristic of a character or location in play, such as \{S\} or \{L\}.
        //
        //       **7.8.1.1. **A modifier applies to a card continuously, either for a fixed length of time or for as long as the card generating the modifier is in play. Whenever a modifier applies to a card's characteristic, that characteristic changes immediately.
        //
        //             This process doesn't use the bag (see 8.7, "Bag").
        //
        //       **7.8.1.2. **When multiple modifiers apply to a card's characteristic, they don't apply in any specific order but all combine to apply together. If a new modifier would apply to a card's characteristic, it combines with all other modifiers that apply to it.
        //
        //         ***Example A:** The active player plays Grand Duke – Advisor to the King. He has an ability cal ed Yes, Your Majesty that* *reads, "Your Prince, Princess, King, and Queen characters get \+1 *\{S\} *. The \+1 *\{S\} * modifier generated by the ability's* *effect applies immediately to the *\{S\} * of all characters the active player has in play with the Prince, Princess, King, and* *Queen classifications. If that player plays another character with one of these classifications while their Grand Duke is* *still in play, the new character enters play with the \+1 *\{S\} * modifier applied and keeps that modification until the Grand* *Duke leaves play. *
        //
        //         ***Example B:** The active player has a Heihei – Rambling Rooster in play with 2 *\{S\} * and 2 *\{W\} *. Heihei gets \+1 *\{S\} * from an* *effect. Heihei now has 3 *\{S\} * and 2 *\{W\} *. Later in the turn, an additional effect gives Heihei -5 *\{S\} *. Heihei's *\{S\} * is modified* *to be -2 *\{S\} *. A later effect gives Heihei \+1 *\{S\} *, bringing him to -1 *\{S\} *. Each time a modifier applies to Heihei, all other* *modifiers that apply to him combine with it at the same time. *
        //
        //         **7.8.2. **If a character has a negative \{S\}, it deals no damage during chal enges and counts as having a Strength of 0 except for the purpose of applying modifiers to determine its \{S\} (see 7.8.1.1 and 7.8.1.2).
        //
        //       ***Example:** The active player has a Yokai – Scientific Supervil ain and a Microbots in play. Yokai has a triggered ability cal ed* *Technical Gain that reads, "Whenever this character quests, draw a card for each opposing character with 0 *\{S\} *." Microbots has* *a triggered ability cal ed Inspired Tech that reads, "When you play this item, chosen character gets -1 *\{S\} * this turn for each item* *named Microbots you have in play." The opponent has a character with 1 *\{S\} * and 1 *\{W\} * in play. The active player plays a second* *Microbots. When resolving the triggered ability, the active player chooses the opponent's character. It gets -2 *\{S\} * and, after* *this modifier is applied immediately to its *\{S\} *, now has -1 *\{S\} * and 1 *\{W\} *. The active player then quests with Yokai. Because the* *opposing character's *\{S\} * is negative, the opposing character counts as having a *\{S\} * of 0 when resolving Yokai's triggered ability,* *and the active player draws 1 card. Even though the character's *\{S\} * counts as 0 for the purpose of resolving Yokai's effect, it isn't* *changed to 0 and still has a *\{S\} * of -1. *
        //
        //         **7.8.3. **If a character or location has a negative Lore value \{L\}, it counts as having a Lore value of 0 except for the purpose of applying modifiers to determine its \{L\} (see 7.8.1.1 and 7.8.1.2).
        //
        //       ***Example:** The active player has a Flynn Rider – His Own Biggest Fan in play, and their opponent has 5 cards in their hand. Flynn* *has 4 *\{L\} * and an ability cal ed One Last, Big Score that reads, "This character gets -1 *\{L\} * for each card in your opponents' hands." *
        //
        //       *Because the opponent has 5 cards in their hand, a modifier of -5 applies to Flynn's Lore value of 4 \(-1 for each of the 5 cards\). *
        //
        //       *Flynn now has a new Lore value of -1. Because Flynn's Lore value is negative, if the player exerts him to quest, Flynn counts as* *having a Lore value of 0 and the player gains 0 lore. This doesn't change Flynn's actual Lore value to 0, however. Flynn still has a* *Lore value of -1 until the number of cards in the opponent's hand changes or another modifier is applied to his Lore value. *
