// **7.5. Activated Abilities**
// **7.5.1.** Activated abilities are abilities that a player chooses to use. They are normally written as [Cost] â€” [Effect].
// **7.5.2.** While there are no effects waiting to resolve and a character isn't questing or in a challenge, the active player may use an activated ability.
// **7.5.3.** To use an activated ability, the active player follows these steps in order. If any part of this process can't be performed, it's illegal to use the ability.
// **7.5.3.1.** First, the active player announces the ability they intend to use.
// **7.5.3.2.** Second, the player follows the steps described in 4.3.4.4 through 4.3.4.6, replacing any instance of the word "card" with the word "ability."
// **7.5.3.3.** Once the total cost is paid, the ability is activated. The active player resolves the effect immediately.
// **7.5.4.** If an effect would trigger as a result of any of the steps to using an activated ability, that effect waits to resolve until the ability is fully resolved.
