# Lorcana Implementation Specification

## Document Purpose and Context

This document serves as the central coordination point for implementing Lorcana-specific features in the core engine. It is designed to be used by multiple AI agents working in parallel on different aspects of the implementation.

### How to Use This Document

1. **Before Starting Work**: Check the Implementation Status section to see what's being worked on
2. **When Starting a Task**: Update the status to "in_progress" with your agent ID and timestamp
3. **When Completing a Task**: Update the status to "completed" with implementation details
4. **Dependencies**: Check the Dependencies section before starting work on a feature

### Coordination Protocol

- Each agent should claim a specific requirement by marking it "in_progress"
- Agents should avoid working on items with dependencies that aren't completed
- Use the "Implementation Notes" section to communicate important details
- Update the "Integration Points" when your work affects other components

## High-Level Requirements

The current GameDefinition interface is missing several key features needed for Lorcana:

1. **Segment System Integration**: Integration between segments (preGame → duringGame → endGame) and flow configuration
2. **Triggered Ability System**: A "bag" or stack system for triggered abilities with complex resolution ordering
3. **Turn Action Restrictions**: "Once per turn" restrictions (like inkwell) at the configuration level
4. **Automatic State Checks**: Automatic state validation after each action/resolution
5. **Complex Priority Rules**: Support for "active player resolves all their triggers first" rule
6. **Conditional Step/Phase Execution**: Support for conditional steps (e.g., skip draw on first turn)
7. **Sub-steps within Phases**: Dynamic sub-steps like "bag resolution" within main phase
8. **Multi-zone State Management**: Explicit support for multiple game zones

## Integration Points

### FlowConfiguration Enhancement
The FlowConfiguration interface needs to be extended to support:
- Trigger resolution configuration
- Turn restrictions
- State check configuration
- Conditional execution
- Dynamic sub-steps

### GameDefinition Enhancement
The GameDefinition interface needs:
- Segment configuration alongside flow
- Zone configuration
- State check configuration
- Turn restriction configuration

### Context (Ctx) Enhancement
The game context needs:
- Current segment tracking
- Priority context
- Restriction usage tracking
- Active sub-steps tracking

## Implementation Notes

### Priority Order
1. Start with foundational features that others depend on:
   - Multi-zone State Management (no dependencies)
   - Segment System Integration (no dependencies)
   - Triggered Ability System (required by 4 and 5)

2. Then implement dependent features:
   - Automatic State Checks (depends on triggers)
   - Complex Priority Rules (depends on triggers)

3. Finally, implement enhancement features:
   - Turn Action Restrictions
   - Conditional Step/Phase Execution
   - Sub-steps within Phases

### Testing Strategy
- Each feature should have comprehensive unit tests
- Integration tests should be added as features are combined
- Use Lorcana-specific scenarios for test cases
