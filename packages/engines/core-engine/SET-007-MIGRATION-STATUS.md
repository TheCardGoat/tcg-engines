# Lorcana Set 007 Action Cards Migration - Status Report

**Date**: 2025-10-05
**Status**: üü¢ **Phase 2 - 69% Complete** (20/29 tests passing)

## Spec Reference

**Spec Document**: `.agent-os/packages/core-engine/specs/2025-10-05-incremental-framework-migration/spec.md`
**Tasks Document**: `.agent-os/packages/core-engine/specs/2025-10-05-incremental-framework-migration/tasks.md`

## Executive Summary

The Set 007 action cards migration is progressing well with **69% of tests passing** (20 passing, 6 skipped, 3 failing). Significant framework capabilities have been validated and extended, including scry effects with player targeting, modal effects, conditional logic, dynamic values, challenge restrictions, and same-zone card repositioning. The remaining 3 failing tests require major infrastructure (optional abilities, challenge system) that represents fundamental framework extensions beyond the current scope.

---

## Recommendations

### Option 1: Mark Spec as "Substantially Complete" (Recommended)
**Rationale**:
- 69% tests passing with well-understood blockers
- Remaining 3 failing tests require major framework infrastructure
- All achievable framework extensions completed
- Significant bugs fixed (same-zone moves, drawCard)
- Failing tests documented with complexity analysis

**Documentation Needed**:
- Update spec status to "Substantially Complete - 69%"
- Document remaining work as future framework tasks
- Create follow-up specs for optional abilities and challenge system

### Option 2: Focus on Set 008 Completion
**Rationale**:
- Set 008 is at 89% passing (40/45)
- Only 4 failing tests vs 3 in Set 007
- May have easier wins with closer proximity to 100%

### Option 3: Implement Return Of Hercules (Not Recommended)
**Effort**: Very High (8-16 hours)
**Impact**: +2 tests (76% passing)
**Complexity**: Requires full optional ability system - major framework work

‚úÖ Conditional effects with branching logic
‚úÖ Modal effects with separate targeting
‚úÖ Dynamic value resolution system

---

## Summary

The Set 007 migration has successfully validated and extended the core framework to handle **69% of action card effects** (20/29 tests passing). This session completed Water Has Memory by implementing player-targeted scry effects and fixing a critical bug in same-zone card moves that was causing duplicate cards during deck rearrangement.

The remaining **10% failing tests** (3 tests) require fundamental framework infrastructure (optional abilities, challenge system) that represents major engineering efforts beyond typical effect handlers. The 21% skipped tests (6 tests) are intentionally deferred features documented in test files.

**Recommendation**: Mark this migration "substantially complete" at 69% passing, with clear documentation of remaining work for future framework tasks. The achievable improvements have been completed, and the remaining work requires major system design efforts.
