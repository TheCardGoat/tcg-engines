 * Implementation of the Gundam Card Game mulligan rule:

 * Players are not required to redraw if they do not wish to.
 *
 * 5-2-1-6-1. If you decide to redraw, return your entire hand to the bottom of your deck
 * and draw five new cards, which will become your new starting hand. Then, shuffle your deck.
