/**
 * # Game-Specific Type System
 *
 * This module defines the generic type system that allows games to extend
 * CoreEngine with their own specific types while maintaining type safety.
 *
 * ## Architecture
 * - Base types define the minimum required interface
 * - Game-specific types extend these bases with additional properties
 * - Generic constraints ensure type safety across the engine
