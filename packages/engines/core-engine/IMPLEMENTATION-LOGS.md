## 2023-08-13: Fix TypeScript errors in Lorcana engine

### Error Description
When running `bun run check`, we encountered several TypeScript errors in the Lorcana engine related to missing effect types. The following errors were found:

1. In `src/game-engine/engines/lorcana/src/abilities/trigger-resolver.ts`:
   - Error TS2678: Type '"multiEffect"' is not comparable to type 'EffectType'.

2. In `src/game-engine/engines/lorcana/src/operations/modules/add-triggered-effects-to-bag.ts`:
   - Error TS2345: Argument of type with 'multiEffect' type was not assignable to parameter of type 'LayerItem'.
   - Type '"multiEffect"' is not assignable to type 'EffectType'.

3. In `src/game-engine/engines/lorcana/src/operations/modules/resolve-bag-trigger.ts`:
   - Error TS2678: Type '"basicInkwellTrigger"' is not comparable to type 'EffectType'.

### Root Cause Analysis
The effect types "multiEffect" and "basicInkwellTrigger" were being used in the codebase, but they weren't defined in the `EffectType` union type in `ability-types.ts`.

### Fix Implementation
Added the missing effect types to the `EffectType` union type in `src/game-engine/engines/lorcana/src/abilities/ability-types.ts`:

```typescript
export type EffectType =
  // ... existing types ...
  
  // Composite effects
  | "multiEffect" // Container for multiple effects
  | "basicInkwellTrigger" // Special trigger for inkwell actions
  
  // ... more existing types ...
```

### Verification
After adding these missing types, ran `bun run check` again and all checks passed successfully:
- All TypeScript type errors were resolved
- All tests passed (478 tests across 49 files)
- Formatting and linting checks also passed

### Notes
These types appear to be used for handling composite effects (effects that contain multiple sub-effects) and special triggers for inkwell mechanics in the Lorcana card game. The `multiEffect` type seems to be used when a card ability needs to apply multiple different effects at once, while the `basicInkwellTrigger` type is specifically for handling the inkwell mechanic where cards are put into the inkwell and trigger abilities.
