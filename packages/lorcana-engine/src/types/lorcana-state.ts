 * - Ink management (total capacity and available per turn)
 * - Character states (drying status, damage, exerted)
 * - Turn metadata (cards played, characters questing, ink used)
 * - Challenge state for combat resolution
 * - Location and item states
 *
 * References:
 * - Rule 3.1.4 (Lore starts at 0)
 * - Rule 4.2.2.1 (Drying characters)
 * - Rule 4.3.3 (Inkwell - once per turn)
 * - Rule 4.3.6 (Challenge mechanics)
