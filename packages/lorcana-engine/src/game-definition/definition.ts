 * Complete Lorcana Game Definition
 *
 * Modular architecture with single responsibility:
 * - zones/: Zone configurations
 * - flow/: Turn and phase flow
 * - moves/: All game moves organized by category
 * - trackers/: Action tracking configuration
 * - setup/: Game initialization
 * - win-conditions/: Victory conditions
 *
 * Benefits:
 * - Easy to navigate and maintain
 * - Test components in isolation
 * - Clear separation of concerns
 * - Scalable for future additions
