/**
 * Card Data Module
 *
 * This module will contain card definitions including:
 * - Card stats (ink cost, strength, willpower, lore value)
 * - Card classifications and types
 * - Ability text (parsed into Ability objects)
 * - Card metadata (set, rarity, etc.)
 *
 * Card data is stored separately from the engine to allow:
 * - Independent versioning of card data
 * - Easy updates without engine changes
 * - Build-time card processing
 *
 * @module data
