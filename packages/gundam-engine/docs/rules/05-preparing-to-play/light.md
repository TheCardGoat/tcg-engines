# Section 5: Preparing to Play - Light Summary

This document provides a streamlined overview of pre-game setup and deck construction rules for the Gundam Card Game.

## Deck Construction Requirements

### Main Deck (50 cards exactly)
- **Card Types**: Unit, Pilot, Command, and Base cards
- **Color Restriction**: Must use either one or two colors only
  - Example: All red cards is legal
  - Example: Green and white mix is legal
- **Copy Limit**: Up to 4 copies of any card (by card number)

### Resource Deck (10 cards exactly)

- **Copy Limit**: Any number of copies allowed

### Required Tokens
- **EX Base token**: One per player (0 AP / 3 HP)
- **EX Resource token**: One per player
- Additional tokens as needed for gameplay

## Pre-Game Setup Sequence

### Step 1: Present Decks
Both players present their deck and resource deck. Decks must conform to construction rules.

### Step 2: Shuffle Main Deck
Each player thoroughly shuffles their deck and places it face down in their deck area.

### Step 3: Place Resource Deck
Each player places their resource deck face down in their resource deck area.

### Step 4: Determine Player Order
- Use a random method (rock-paper-scissors, dice roll, etc.)
- Winner decides who becomes Player One

### Step 5: Draw Starting Hand
Each player draws 5 cards from their deck as their starting hand.

### Step 6: Mulligan Decision (Player One)
Player One decides whether to redraw:
- **If redrawing**: Return entire hand to bottom of deck, draw 5 new cards, then shuffle deck
- **Optional**: Players may keep their starting hand

### Step 7: Mulligan Decision (Player Two)
After Player One's decision, Player Two may redraw using the same rules.

### Step 8: Set Up Shields
Each player takes the top 6 cards from their deck and places them face down in the shield section:
- Place cards one at a time
- Overlap each card with the previous one
- Start with the card nearest to you

### Step 9: Place EX Base
Each player places one active EX Base token in the base section of their shield area.

### Step 10: Player Two Resource Advantage
Player Two places one active EX Resource token in their resource area.

### Step 11: Game Start
The game begins with Player One's turn.

## Key Setup Notes

- **Shield Placement**: Cards are placed face down and cannot be viewed or reordered
- **Starting Resources**: Only Player Two starts with an EX Resource (goes second advantage)
- **Starting Field**: Both players begin with an EX Base in their shield area
- **No Reshuffles**: After mulligans, players do not shuffle again before placing shields

## Mulligan Rules Summary

- Each player may redraw once
- Player One decides first, then Player Two
- Must return entire hand (cannot keep any cards)
- Draw exactly 5 new cards
- Shuffle deck after returning cards
