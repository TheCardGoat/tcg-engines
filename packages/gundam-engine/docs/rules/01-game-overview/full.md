# Section 1: Game Overview

## 1-1. Number of Players

### 1-1-1
Gundam Card Game is a competitive game between two players. Refer to the multiplayer rules for rules that apply to games conducted with other player counts.

## 1-2. Winning and Losing the Game

### 1-2-1
When either player is defeated, the game ends. When one opponent is defeated, the opponent who was not defeated wins the game.

### 1-2-2
The following are all game conditions that result in defeat.

#### 1-2-2-1
When either player receives battle damage from a Unit while they have no cards in their shield area, that player fulfills the conditions for defeat.

#### 1-2-2-2
When either player has no cards remaining in their deck, that player fulfills the conditions for defeat.

### 1-2-3
During a game, any player may concede at any time. That player immediately loses and the game ends.

### 1-2-4
There are no card effects that force a player to concede. Loss of the game by conceding is never a substitution of any substitution effect.

## 1-3. Fundamental Game Rules

### 1-3-1
While the rules of the game are fundamentally defined within this comprehensive ruleset, there may be exceptions that arise due a card's effects or special rules. If the text written on a card contradicts the comprehensive rules, the text on the card takes precedence.

### 1-3-2
If a player is required to perform an action that is not possible for any reason, that action is not performed. If a player is required to perform an action and only part of that action is not possible, the player must perform as much of the action as possible.

#### 1-3-2-1
If you are required to put an entity into some state that entity is already in, the entity remains in the state it was in, and the action putting it into that state is not performed.

Ex: If you are instructed to rest a Unit that is currently rested, since the Unit is already rested, it is not rested again.

#### 1-3-2-2
If for any reason you are required to perform zero or less repetitions of an action, the action is not performed. An opposite action is not performed for negative repetition counts.

### 1-3-3
When a card's effect requires an action that an active effect prevents, the active effect takes precedence, and the action is prevented.

### 1-3-4
When both players are required for any reason to make a selection simultaneously, the active player chooses first. The standby player chooses after that.

### 1-3-5
Unless specified otherwise, when choosing a number for a card or a rule, you must choose a whole number equal to or greater than one. You cannot choose a negative or fractional number.

### 1-3-6
When numerical information on a card is modified by a card's effect, the result will be a whole number. If the result would be negative, treat it as zero unless it will be modified by another effect.

### 1-3-7
Unless specified otherwise, a card's effects are performed in the order they appear in the text on the card.
