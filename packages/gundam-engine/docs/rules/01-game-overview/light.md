# Section 1: Game Overview - Light Summary

## Overview

The Gundam Card Game is a competitive two-player card game where players battle using Units, Pilots, and Commands to defeat their opponent.

## Number of Players

- **Standard Play**: 2 players
- **Multiplayer**: Refer to multiplayer rules for other player counts

## Objective

Defeat your opponent by attacking their shield area and ultimately dealing battle damage when they have no shields remaining.

## Winning Conditions

The game ends when either player is defeated. The player who is not defeated wins the game.

## Defeat Conditions

A player is defeated when:

1. **No Shield Defense**: A player receives battle damage from a Unit while having no cards in their shield area
2. **Deck Depletion**: A player has no cards remaining in their deck

## Conceding

- Any player may concede at any time during a game
- The player who concedes immediately loses and the game ends
- Card effects cannot force a player to concede
- Conceding is not affected by substitution effects

## Fundamental Game Rules

### Rule Priority

- **Card Text vs Rules**: If a card's text contradicts the comprehensive rules, the card text takes precedence
- Card effects and special rules can create exceptions to standard game rules

### Impossible Actions

- **Partial Completion**: If an action is impossible to perform completely, perform as much as possible
- **No Action Needed**: If an action cannot be performed at all, do not perform it
- **Already in State**: If instructed to put something in a state it's already in, no action is performed

Example: Resting an already rested Unit does nothing - the Unit stays rested

### Zero or Negative Actions

- If required to perform zero or less repetitions of an action, do not perform the action
- Negative counts do not cause opposite actions

### Conflicting Effects

When a card effect requires an action that another active effect prevents, the preventing effect takes precedence and the action is blocked.

### Simultaneous Choices

When both players must make selections simultaneously:
1. Active player chooses first
2. Standby player chooses second

### Numerical Rules

- **Number Selection**: Unless specified otherwise, choose whole numbers equal to or greater than one
- **No Negatives or Fractions**: Cannot choose negative or fractional numbers
- **Modified Values**: When card values are modified by effects, the result is a whole number
- **Negative Results**: Negative results are treated as zero (unless further modifications apply)

### Effect Ordering

Unless specified otherwise, perform a card's effects in the order they appear in the card text.

## Key Gameplay Concepts

### Turn Structure

Each turn consists of five phases:
1. Start Phase
2. Draw Phase
3. Resource Phase
4. Main Phase
5. End Phase

### Core Actions

- **Deploy Units**: Place Unit cards from hand onto the battle area
- **Pair Pilots**: Place Pilot cards beneath Units to enhance them
- **Play Commands**: Activate one-time command effects
- **Attack**: Use Units to attack opponent or enemy Units
- **Manage Resources**: Place Resources to pay for cards

### Battle Area

- Maximum 6 Units in battle area at once
- Units can attack opponents or enemy Units
- Units deal damage equal to their AP (Attack Points)
- Units are destroyed when HP (Hit Points) reaches zero

### Shield Area

- Shields protect players from direct damage
- Base cards can be deployed to the shield area
- Shields are destroyed when taking damage
- Game ends if player takes damage with no shields

### Resource System

- Resources are used to pay costs for playing cards
- Maximum 15 Resources (including maximum 5 EX Resources)
- Resources can be active (vertical) or rested (horizontal)
- Rest active Resources to pay card costs

## Card Types

- **Unit**: Cards placed in battle area to attack and defend
- **Pilot**: Cards placed beneath Units to enhance them
- **Command**: One-time effect cards
- **Base**: Cards placed in shield area with defensive capabilities
- **Resource**: Cards used to pay costs (separate deck)

## Strategic Elements

- **Link Units**: Units with Pilots matching link conditions can attack immediately
- **AP/HP Management**: Track Attack Points and Hit Points for combat
- **Level Requirements**: Must have sufficient Resources in resource area to play cards
- **Cost Payment**: Rest Resources to pay card costs
