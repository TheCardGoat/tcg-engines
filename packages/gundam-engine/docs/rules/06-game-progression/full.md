# Section 6: Game Progression

6-1. Turn Flow

6-1-1. Each turn progresses with the completion of five phases in order: start phase, draw phase, resource phase, main phase, and end phase.

6-1-2. During a game, one of the two players controls game progress as the active player. The active player completes phases in the order described below.

6-1-3. During each phase, if effects are triggered by actions taken that phase, play does not advance to the next phase until all of those effects are resolved.

6-2. Start Phase

6-2-1. The start phase consists of two steps, which are performed in order: active step and start step.

6-2-2. Active Step

6-2-2-1. The active player sets to active all rested cards placed in their battle area, resource area, and the base section of their shield area.

6-2-2-2. All cards are set to active simultaneously during the active step, and in no particular order.

6-2-3. Start Step

6-2-3-1. Effects that specify "at the start of the turn" activate.

6-3. Draw Phase

6-3-1. The active player draws one card from their deck and adds it to their hand.

6-3-1-1. When they draw a card and their deck then has no cards in it, they immediately lose the game.

6-4. Resource Phase

6-4-1. The active player places one Resource card from their resource deck into their resource area face up and active.

<a id="6-5-main-phase"></a>6-5. Main Phase

6-5-1. The active player may choose from the following list of actions permitted during the main phase: play a card from their hand, activate an 【Activate•

Main】 effect, and attack with a Unit. These actions may be performed in any order as many times as desired within their permissible limits. With the exception of actions performed due to an ability, these actions may only be performed when there are currently no abilities that have been triggered and are awaiting activation.

6-5-2-3-2. A Unit paired with a Pilot matching its link conditions is referred to as a Link Unit.

6-5-2-3-3. A Pilot cannot be paired with a Unit that is already paired with another Pilot. As a rule, a Unit can only have at most one pilot paired with it.

6-5-2-3-3-1. You cannot freely remove a paired Pilot from a Unit or exchange it with another Pilot.

6-5-2-3-4. When a Unit paired with a Pilot is destroyed, returned to the hand, or otherwise moved from the battle area to another location, the paired Pilot is moved to the same location as the Unit.
