# Section 6: Game Progression (Light Summary)

## Overview

Each turn in the Gundam Card Game progresses through five distinct phases in sequential order. The active player controls game progress and completes each phase before advancing to the next.

## Turn Structure

### 6-1. Turn Flow

A complete turn consists of five phases executed in this order:
1. Start Phase
2. Draw Phase
3. Resource Phase
4. Main Phase
5. End Phase

**Important**: If effects are triggered by actions during a phase, play does not advance to the next phase until all triggered effects are fully resolved.

## The Five Phases

### 6-2. Start Phase

The start phase consists of two steps performed sequentially:

#### Active Step
- The active player sets all rested cards to active
- Applies to cards in: battle area, resource area, and base section of shield area
- All cards become active simultaneously (no specific order)

#### Start Step
- Effects that specify "at the start of the turn" activate
- Triggered effects are resolved before proceeding

### 6-3. Draw Phase

**Simple Action**: The active player draws one card from their deck and adds it to their hand.

**Defeat Condition**: If a player draws a card and their deck becomes empty, they immediately lose the game.

### 6-4. Resource Phase

**Simple Action**: The active player places one Resource card from their resource deck into their resource area face up and active.

### 6-5. Main Phase

The main phase allows the active player the most flexibility. The following actions may be performed in any order, any number of times, within their permissible limits:

#### Available Actions

1. **Play Cards from Hand**
   - Deploy Units
   - Deploy Bases
   - Pair Pilots
   - Activate Command cards with [Main]

2. **Activate [Activate•Main] Effects**
   - Activate effects on cards already in play that specify [Activate•Main]

3. **Attack with Units**
   - Declare attacks against the opposing player or rested enemy Units

#### Playing Cards from Hand

**Unit Deployment**
- Pay the Unit card's cost
- Play it from hand and deploy into the battle area
- Some abilities can deploy Units from other locations

**Base Deployment**
- Pay the Base card's cost
- Play it from hand and deploy into the base section of shield area
- Some abilities can deploy Bases from other locations

**Pilot Pairing**
- Pay the Pilot card's cost
- Play it from hand and pair it beneath a Unit already in battle area
- A Unit paired with a Pilot matching its link conditions becomes a Link Unit
- A Unit can only have one Pilot (cannot freely remove or exchange)
- When a Unit moves locations, the paired Pilot moves with it
- Command cards with Pilot effects can be paired as Pilots

**Command Cards with [Main]**
- Pay the Command card's cost
- Play it from hand and activate its [Main] effect

#### Action Restrictions

- Most actions can only be performed when no abilities are awaiting activation
- Actions performed due to an ability are exceptions to this rule

#### Ending the Main Phase

The active player may declare the end of the main phase at any time, immediately transitioning to the end phase.

### 6-6. End Phase

The end phase consists of four steps performed sequentially:

#### Action Step
- Taking turns starting with the standby player
- Players can activate [Action] Command cards and [Activate•Action] effects
- See Section 8 for detailed action step rules

#### End Step
- Effects that specify "at the end of the turn" activate
- Triggered effects are resolved

#### Hand Step
- If hand size exceeds 10 cards, discard down to 10
- Active player chooses which cards to discard

#### Cleanup Step
- Effects with duration "during this turn" lose effect
- Resolve any triggered effects that activate as a result

**Turn Transition**: After all end phase steps are complete, the turn passes to the opponent.

## Key Concepts

**Active vs. Standby Player**: The active player controls turn progression. The standby player is their opponent. Players alternate being the active player each turn.

**Phase Completion**: A phase only ends when all triggered effects within that phase have been fully resolved.

**Main Phase Flexibility**: Unlike other phases with prescribed actions, the main phase allows strategic sequencing of multiple action types.

**Action Steps**: Special interaction windows that occur both during combat (after block step) and during end phase, allowing both players to respond.
