# Section 4: Essential Game Terminology - Light Summary

## Overview

This section defines the core terminology used throughout the Gundam Card Game. Understanding these terms is essential for proper gameplay.

## Game Terms

### Active and Rested

**Active**: Card placed vertically, has not yet taken an action
- Cards enter battle area, resource area, and base section in active state
- Active Resources can be rested to pay costs

**Rested**: Card placed horizontally, has finished taking an action
- Units rest when attacking
- Resources rest when paying costs
- Shields are placed rested in shield section

### Active Player and Standby Player

**Active Player**: The player responsible for advancing the current turn
- Takes primary actions during their turn
- Makes selections first in simultaneous choices

**Standby Player**: The player not responsible for advancing the current turn
- Can respond during action steps
- Makes selections second in simultaneous choices

### Counter

Physical markers placed on cards to track information:
- Typically used to show damage received
- Place objects (chips, dice) on cards to show counter count
- Remove counters when instructed
- Most common use: tracking damage on Units and Bases

### Damage

Reduction of HP equal to damage amount received:
- **Battle Damage**: Damage from combat between Units or attacks on Bases/Shields
- **Effect Damage**: Damage from card effects
- Track damage with counters on the card
- Card destroyed when HP reaches zero
- Zero damage is not dealt
- Excess damage to Base/Shield doesn't carry over

### Deploy

Placing a Unit or Base onto the field:
- Units deployed to battle area
- Bases deployed to base section of shield area
- Can deploy from hand or by card effects

### Destroy

Placing a card from field to trash:
- **Unit**: Destroyed from battle area to trash
- **Base**: Destroyed from base section to trash
- **Shield**: Destroyed from shield section to trash
- **Resource**: Destroyed from resource area back to resource deck face down
- Triggers "destroyed" effects
- Different from "remove" - destroyed cards trigger destruction effects

### Discard

Placing a card from hand to trash:
- Voluntary or forced by effects
- Hand limit enforcement during end phase
- Part of various card costs

### Draw (a Card)

Moving the top card of your deck to your hand without revealing it:
- "Draw 1" means draw one card from deck
- Don't show drawn card to opponent
- Draw phase: draw 1 card each turn
- Defeat condition: no cards left to draw

### Effect

Text printed on a card within a defined region:
- Includes keyword effects (Support, Blocker, etc.)
- Five types: constant, triggered, activated, command, substitution
- Effects only affect battle area unless specified otherwise

### Forward Slash (/)

The "/" character used in traits and other places:
- Functions as "or" conjunction
- Example: "(Zeon)/(Neo Zeon) Unit" means choose either Zeon OR Neo Zeon Unit

### Gain

A Unit receiving an additional effect:
- Effect is added to the Unit
- Duration depends on effect text
- Can gain keyword effects, stat boosts, etc.

### HP Recovery

Removing damage counters from a Unit or Base:
- Remove counters equal to recovery amount
- If recovery exceeds current damage, remove all counters
- Units with no damage cannot recover HP
- Healing effects typically specify amount

### Pair

Placing a Pilot card beneath a Unit:
- Pilot's AP/HP modifiers added to Unit
- Pilot's effects become Unit's effects
- Creates Link Unit if link conditions met
- Command cards with Pilot effects can be paired

### Play

Paying the cost of a card in your hand to use it:

### Player

The owner of a card:
- "Owner" in card text refers to card's owner
- All cards returned to owners at game end
- Each player controls their own locations

### Randomly

Cards handled without intentional player interference:
