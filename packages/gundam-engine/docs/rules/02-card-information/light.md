#### Resource Cards

- Required to pay costs for playing cards
- "Resource" refers to Resource cards regardless of location

### 2-4. Color

- Four colors exist: blue, green, red, and white
- Resource cards and tokens have no color

### 2-8. Lv. (Level)
- Number of Resources required when playing a card
- Satisfied when your resource area has equal or greater Resources than the Lv.
- Active or rested status of Resources doesn't matter
- All cards except Resources and tokens have a Lv.
- Token Lv. is treated as zero

## Key Concepts

**Link Units**: Units paired with Pilots satisfying their link conditions gain immediate attack capability, unlike normal Units which have summoning sickness.

**Dual-Purpose Commands**: Some Command cards can be played either as one-time effects or placed beneath Units as Pilots, offering strategic flexibility.

**Burst Effects**: Command cards with [Burst] can activate when destroyed as Shields, providing defensive counterplay options.
