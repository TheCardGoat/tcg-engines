# Section 8: Action Steps - Light Summary

This document provides a streamlined overview of action step mechanics in the Gundam Card Game.

## What is an Action Step?

An action step is a special timing window where players can activate specific types of effects. It occurs at two distinct times during gameplay:

1. **During Battle**: After the block step of a Unit attack
2. **During End Phase**: As the first step of the end phase

## When Action Steps Occur

### Battle Action Step
- Occurs after the block step
- Before the damage step
- Allows players to modify the battle before damage is dealt

### End Phase Action Step
- Occurs at the start of the end phase
- After the active player declares end of main phase
- Before the end step

## What Can Be Done During Action Steps

Players may perform one of three actions during an action step:

1. **Activate a 【Action】 Command card**: Pay the cost of a Command card with the 【Action】 keyword from your hand to play it and activate its effect

2. **Activate an 【Activate･Action】 effect**: Fulfill the conditions for an 【Activate･Action】 effect on a card you control and activate it

3. **Pass**: Do nothing and pass priority to your opponent

## Action Step Turn Order

Action steps follow a specific priority system:

### Priority Structure
- **First Priority**: Standby player (the player not taking the current turn)
- **Second Priority**: Active player (the player taking the current turn)

### Back-and-Forth Pattern
1. Standby player takes an action or passes
2. Active player takes an action or passes
3. If either player took an action (not a pass), return to step 1
4. If both players pass consecutively, the action step ends

## Action Step Sequence

### Step-by-Step Process

1. **Standby Player's Turn**
   - Choose: Activate 【Action】 Command card, activate 【Activate･Action】 effect, or pass

2. **Active Player's Turn**
   - Choose: Activate 【Action】 Command card, activate 【Activate･Action】 effect, or pass

3. **Check for End Condition**
   - If both players just passed consecutively: End the action step
   - If at least one player took an action: Return to step 1

### Consecutive Passes Required
The action step only ends when **both players pass in a row**. If the standby player passes but the active player takes an action, the standby player gets priority again.

## Key Rules for Action Steps

### Command Card Activation
- Must have 【Action】 keyword
- Pay the card's cost by resting Resources
- Play from hand
- Effect activates immediately

### Activated Effect Activation
- Must have 【Activate･Action】 keyword
- Fulfill any conditions listed before the colon
- Can be activated from cards already in play

### Passing
- Doing nothing
- Does not cost anything
- Gives priority to opponent
- Does not end the action step unless opponent also passes

## Strategic Notes

### Standby Player Advantage
- Gets first opportunity to act
- Can respond to battle situation before active player
- Can set up defensive plays

### Active Player Response
- Can respond to standby player's actions
- Can set up offensive plays
- Goes second but gets last word if standby passes first

### Multiple Actions
- Players can take multiple actions in the same action step
- Each action alternates between players
- Must pass to signal you're done

## Important Timing Distinctions

### What 【Action】 Effects Cannot Do
- Cannot be activated during main phase (use 【Main】 instead)
- Cannot pair Pilots during action steps
- Cannot deploy Units or Bases during action steps

### What 【Action】 Effects Can Do
- Modify Units in battle
- Destroy Units or Bases
- Draw cards
- Any effect the Command card text allows
