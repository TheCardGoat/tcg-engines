# Section 8: Action Steps

## 8-1. Action Step Timing
An action step occurs after the block step and during the end phase.

## 8-2. Action Step Overview
During an action step, taking turns starting with the standby player, players may activate 【Action】 Command cards and 【Activate･Action】 effects.

## 8-3. Standby Player Actions
The standby player may choose to perform one of the following actions: activate an 【Action】 Command card, activate an 【Activate･Action】 effect, or pass.

### 8-3-1. Activating 【Action】 Command Cards
Activating an 【Action】 Command card is the act of paying the cost of a Command card in your hand with an 【Action】 effect to play it and activate that effect.

### 8-3-2. Activating 【Activate･Action】 Effects
Activating an 【Activate･Action】 effect is the act of fulfilling the conditions for an 【Activate･Action】 effect on a card and activating it.

### 8-3-3. Passing
Pass means doing nothing and letting the right to take an action pass to your opponent.

## 8-4. Active Player Actions
Next, the active player may choose one of the following actions: activate an 【Action】 Command card, activate an 【Activate･Action】 effect, or pass.

### 8-4-1. Continuing the Action Step
Unless both players have consecutively declared that they are passing, the right to take an action once again passes back to the standby player.

### 8-4-2. Action Step Continuation Pattern
Continue in this manner, standby player → active player → standby player and so on, until both players consecutively declare they are passing.

## 8-5. Ending the Action Step
