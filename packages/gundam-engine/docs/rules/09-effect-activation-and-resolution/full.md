# Section 9: Effect Activation and Resolution

9-1. Effects

9-1-1. An effect consists of a directive and related compensation which originate from the text on a card.

9-1-2. Unless the text specifies otherwise, an effect will only affect cards in the battle area. If a location for where to activate the effect is not specified, an effect on a Unit or Base can only be activated while that card is in the battle area.

9-1-3. Some effects instruct you to perform them, while others state "you may"

perform them. If instructed to perform an effect, perform as much of it as possible. If told "you may" perform an effect, you may also choose not to activate that effect.

9-1-4. Effects are divided into five types, depending on their contents and trigger conditions: constant, triggered, activated, command, and substitution.

9-1-5. Constant Effects

9-1-5-1. A constant effect is an effect that remains constantly active in some form.

9-1-5-2. A constant effect will remain active the entire time it is in a location where it activates.

9-1-5-3. Some constant effects only activate while certain conditions are fulfilled. As long as they are in a location where they activate and those conditions are fulfilled, they will remain active the entire time.

9-1-5-4. Constant effects do not wait to be triggered or activated. They are active from the moment they enter the location where they activate.

9-1-5-5. When multiple constant effects are active, they will all overlap.

9-1-5-6. When multiple constant effects with conflicting contents are active, effects that state other effects "can't" have an effect, or otherwise disallow them, take precedence.

9-1-5-7. A constant effect with a conditional target is applied the moment a target fulfilling those conditions appears.

9-1-6. Triggered Effects

## 20

9-1-6-1. A triggered effect activates automatically when some conditional event occurs during the game. Triggered effects include effects that specify timing, such as 【 Deploy 】 , 【 When Attacking 】 ,

【Destroyed】, and 【When Paired】. They also include effects that include a condition such as "when (some event occurs)" in their text.

9-1-6-1-1. In the absence of a restriction, such as 【Once per Turn】, the effect activates every time the condition is fulfilled.

9-1-6-2. A triggered effect will not trigger or activate unless its trigger conditions are fulfilled.

9-1-6-3. If multiple events fulfilling a trigger condition occur simultaneously, the effect will only trigger and activate one time.

9-1-6-4. If a card with a triggered effect leaves the location where it is active while that effect is waiting to be activated after it was triggered, the effect still activates.

9-1-6-5. If multiple effects belonging to you trigger, they do so simultaneously, and you resolve them in the order you decide.

9-1-6-6. If multiple effects belonging to both you and your opponent trigger, they do so simultaneously, and the active player resolves their effects in the order they decide, after which the standby player does the same.

9-1-6-7. If a new effect triggers while multiple effects are being resolved, give that new effect priority and resolve it.

9-1-6-8. If multiple effects trigger and a 【Burst】 effect is among them, give that 【Burst】 effect priority over all others and resolve it first.

9-1-7. Activated Effects

9-1-7-1. An activated effect can be freely activated by the player. These include 【Activate•Main】 and 【Activate•Action】 effects.

9-1-7-2. When an activated effect's timing permits activation, satisfying the actions described before the colon will activate the effect described after the colon.

9-1-7-3. Some activated effects specify the symbol "①" as a condition. When this symbol appears, paying a cost equal to the number printed within the symbol satisfies the condition and allows the effect to be activated.

9-1-7-4. Some activated effects have two or more conditions which appear as

"【Activate•Action】 (condition 1), (condition 2)：." In this case, satisfying all of the conditions will activate the effect described following the colon.

## 21

9-1-7-5. If an activated effect has neither a colon nor conditions for activating it listed, you can activate it by declaring you are doing so.

9-1-8. Command Effects

9-1-8-1. A command effect activates when it is played during the timing specified on a Command card, which can be either 【Main】, or

【Action】, or both.

9-1-8-1-1. If a command effect requires choosing a target, playing that Command card is not possible if that target cannot be chosen.

9-1-9. Substitution Effects

9-1-9-1. When some event would occur, a substitution effect replaces the implementation of that event with another event.

9-1-9-1-1. If an effect reads "(do) B instead of A," the portion B that occurs due to that capability is a substitution effect.

9-2. Effect Conditions

9-2-1. When certain conditions are required for an effect to activate, it will not activate unless those conditions are fulfilled.

9-2-2. If an effect requires choosing a target, that effect will not activate if the target cannot be chosen.

9-2-3. Even if an effect's conditions are fulfilled, that effect will not activate if it is restricted by an effect that disallows it.

9-3. Effect Activation Steps

9-3-1. When activating an effect, follow the steps listed below.

9-3-1-1. If conditions are required to activate the effect, they must be fulfilled, otherwise the effect cannot be activated.

9-3-1-2. Declare you are activating the effect. If the effect is on a card in your hand and can be activated at that time, reveal the card.

9-3-1-3. Activate the declared effect.

9-3-1-4. Resolve all events which occur in response to activating the effect.

9-3-2. If the effect you wish to activate is on a Command card, present the card and perform the effect listed on it.

9-3-3. When a Command card is played or a triggered effect is triggered and its effect instructs you to "choose 1 (card or player)" or "choose up to (some number of cards)," those targets are chosen at the point in time when the instructions appear in the effect.

9-3-3-1. If an effect's target cannot be chosen, that effect does not activate.

9-3-4. If a number to choose is specified, you must choose as many of the indicated 22



cards or players as possible, up to and including that number.

9-3-5. If the text of an effect does not specifically indicate choosing a card or player and the effect is meant to target a card, the card generating the effect is indicated. If the effect is meant to target a player, the player who owns the card generating the effect is indicated.

9-3-6. When choosing a card from the deck, confirm the top of the deck, then choose the specified card from it.
