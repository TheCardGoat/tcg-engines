# 7-7. Battle End Step

## 7-7-1. "During This Battle" Effects Expire

At the beginning of the Battle End Step, all effects that were designated as lasting "during this battle" expire and cease to have any effect. Units return to their normal state, losing any temporary modifications that were applied during the battle sequence.

## 7-7-2. Returning to Main Phase

After all Battle End Step procedures are completed, the battle sequence is fully resolved and the game returns to the Main Phase. The turn player may then proceed with additional actions during their Main Phase, including declaring additional attacks with other Units if they are able to do so.
