# 7. Attacking and Battles

7-1. Using a main phase attack with a Unit, the active player may use one of their Units to attack the opposing player or a rested enemy Unit in the battle area.

7-2. An attack with a Unit consists of five steps, which are performed in order: attack step, block step, action step, damage step, battle end step.

## 7-3. Attack Step

7-3-1. Select one active Unit in your battle area and rest it, then declare an attack target. The attack target can be either the opposing player or a rested enemy Unit.

7-3-2. 【When Attacking】 effects on the attacking Unit and "when a unit attacks" effects on other Units and cards are triggered. If multiple effects trigger, they do so simultaneously, and the active player activates their effects in the order they decide, after which the standby player does the same.

7-3-3. If activation of a 【When Attacking】 or "when a unit attacks" effect triggers new effects, give those new effects priority and activate them.

7-3-4. Effects worded "during this battle" gain effect now.

7-3-5. After resolving all effects activated up to this point, continue to the block step.

7-3-5-1. At the end of the attack step, if the attacking Unit or the Unit targeted for attack has been destroyed or otherwise moved to another location due to some event, continue to the battle end step rather than the block step.

7-3-5-2. For 【When Attacking】 effects that include target conditions in their text, such as "when you attack a player" or "when you attack a Unit," determine whether or not the specified target satisfies those conditions during the attack step. Even if the originally selected target is changed to a different target by another effect, the target after the change does not influence that determination based on the text conditions.

## 7-4. Block Step

7-4-1. The standby player may activate <Blocker> on one of their active Units in the battle area. When activated, this effect changes the attack target of the attacking Unit to the Unit with <Blocker>.

7-4-2. The <Blocker> effect can be activated only one time in response to each attack.

7-4-3. A Unit originally targeted for attack cannot activate its own <Blocker> effect.

7-4-4. Choosing not to activate a <Blocker> effect is also allowed.

7-4-5. When you have resolved all effects activated during this step, continue to the action step.

7-4-5-1. At the end of the block step, if the attacking Unit or the Unit targeted for attack has been destroyed or otherwise moved to another location due to some event, continue to the battle end step rather than the action step.

## 7-5. Action Step

7-5-1. Taking turns starting with the standby player, players may activate 【Action】 Command cards and 【Activate・Action】 effects. (See 8. Action Steps)

7-5-2. If both players have declared they are passing, end the action step and continue to damage step.

7-5-2-1. At the end of the action step, if the attacking Unit or the Unit targeted for attack has been destroyed or otherwise moved to another location due to some event, continue to the battle end step rather than the damage step.

## 7-6. Damage Step

7-6-1. Confirm the attacking Unit's attack target at this point.

7-6-1-1. If the attack target is a player, an attack on a player succeeds.

7-6-1-2. If the attack target is an enemy Unit, an attack on a Unit succeeds.

### 7-6-2. Attack on a Player

7-6-2-1. After an attack on a player has succeeded, check the opponent's shield area.

7-6-2-2. If there is no Base and not a single Shield in the opponent's shield area, the attacking Unit deals battle damage equal to its AP to the opposing player. A player receiving damage is immediately defeated, and the player who owns the attacking Unit wins the game.

7-6-2-3. If there is a Base in the enemy shield area, the attacking Unit deals an amount of battle damage equal to its AP to the Base targeted for attack.

7-6-2-3-1. Use counters to track damage received. If the Base's HP becomes zero, it is destroyed and placed into the trash.

7-6-2-3-2. If the attacking Unit has <First Strike>, it deals battle damage to the enemy Base before normal battle damage is managed. (See 11-1-5. <First Strike>)

7-6-2-4. If there is a Shield but no Base in the enemy shield area, the attacking Unit deals damage equal to its AP to the top Shield in the shield section of the shield area.

7-6-2-4-1. The Shield receiving damage is destroyed. Place the card into the trash after revealing it. If the revealed card has a 【Burst】 effect, the owner chooses whether or not to activate it.

7-6-2-5. When you have resolved all effects activated during this step, continue to the battle end step.

### 7-6-3. Attack on a Unit

7-6-3-1. If an attack on a Unit succeeds, conduct a battle between the two Units.

7-6-3-2. The attacking Unit deals damage equal to its AP to the Unit targeted for attack simultaneously as the Unit targeted for attack deals damage equal to its AP to the Attacking Unit.

7-6-3-2-1. Use counters to track damage received. If a Unit's HP becomes zero, it is destroyed and placed into the trash.

7-6-3-2-2. If the attacking Unit has <First Strike>, it deals battle damage to the enemy Unit before normal battle damage is managed. (See 11-1-5. <First Strike>)

7-6-3-2-3. If both battling Units are destroyed, their destruction is treated as happening simultaneously.

7-6-3-3. When you have resolved all effects activated during this step, continue to the battle end step.

## 7-7. Battle End Step

7-7-1. All effects worded "during this battle" lose effect.

7-7-2. When you have resolved all effects activated during this step, the battle ends, and you return to the main phase. (See 6-5. Main Phase)
