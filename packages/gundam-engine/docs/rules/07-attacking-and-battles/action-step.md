# 7-5. Action Step

## 7-5-1. Activating 【Action】 Cards and Effects

During the Action Step, players alternate activating 【Action】 cards and effects, beginning with the turn player. The rules for activating 【Action】 cards and effects, as well as the priority system, are detailed in Section 8.

## 7-5-2. Proceeding to Damage Step

After both players pass priority in succession without taking any actions, the game proceeds to the Damage Step.

### 7-5-2-1. Exception for Destroyed or Moved Units

If the attacking Unit is destroyed, removed from the Battle Area, or otherwise becomes invalid during the Action Step, the attack ends immediately and the battle sequence terminates without proceeding to the Damage Step. Similarly, if the target of the attack (whether a player or a Unit) becomes invalid, the attack ends and the battle sequence terminates.
