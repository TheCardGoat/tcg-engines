# 7-3. Attack Step

## 7-3-1. Declaring an Attack

During the attack step, the turn player selects one of their Units in the Stand state and declares an attack. The selected Unit is rested, and the turn player declares the target of the attack (either the opponent or one of their Units).

## 7-3-2. Triggering 【When Attacking】 Effects

When a Unit attacks, any 【When Attacking】 effects associated with that Unit or other relevant cards are triggered and placed on the stack according to the rules in Section 8.

## 7-3-3. Priority for New Triggered Effects

After 【When Attacking】 effects are triggered, if any new effects are triggered as a result, priority is given to resolve those effects according to the priority rules in Section 8.

## 7-3-4. "During This Battle" Effects

Effects that specify "during this battle" gain their effects at this point in the attack step. These effects remain active throughout the entire battle sequence until the Battle End Step.

## 7-3-5. Proceeding to Block Step

After all effects and actions in the attack step are resolved, and both players pass priority in succession, the game proceeds to the Block Step.

### 7-3-5-1. Exception for Destroyed or Moved Units

If the attacking Unit is destroyed, removed from the Battle Area, or otherwise becomes invalid before proceeding to the Block Step, the attack ends immediately and the battle sequence terminates without proceeding to subsequent steps.

### 7-3-5-2. Target Condition Check Timing

When proceeding to the Block Step, the game checks whether the target of the attack is still valid. If the target Unit has been destroyed, removed from the Battle Area, or otherwise become an invalid target, the attack continues but the target is considered to no longer exist for purposes of blocking and damage resolution.
