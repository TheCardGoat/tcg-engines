# 7-4. Block Step

## 7-4-1. Activating <Blocker>

During the Block Step, the defending player may activate the <Blocker> keyword ability on one of their Units to block the attack. When <Blocker> is activated, the blocking Unit becomes the new target of the attack, replacing the original target.

## 7-4-2. Once Per Attack Limit

The <Blocker> ability can only be activated once per attack. After a Unit has blocked an attack using <Blocker>, no other Units may activate <Blocker> for that same attack.

## 7-4-3. Originally Targeted Unit Cannot Block

If the attack was originally declared targeting a specific Unit, that Unit cannot activate <Blocker> to block the attack. Only other Units controlled by the defending player may block.

## 7-4-4. Optional Activation

Activating <Blocker> is optional. The defending player is not required to block an attack even if they control Units with the <Blocker> ability.

## 7-4-5. Proceeding to Action Step

After the defending player has decided whether or not to activate <Blocker>, and all resulting effects have been resolved, the game proceeds to the Action Step.

### 7-4-5-1. Exception for Destroyed or Moved Units

If the attacking Unit is destroyed, removed from the Battle Area, or otherwise becomes invalid during the Block Step, the attack ends immediately and the battle sequence terminates without proceeding to subsequent steps.
