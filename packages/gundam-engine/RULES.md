Comprehensive Rules 

1. ** **Game Overview 

1-1. Number of Players 

1-1-1. Gundam Card Game is a competitive game between two players. Refer to the multiplayer rules for rules that apply to games conducted with other player counts. 

1-2. Winning and Losing the Game 

1-2-1. When either player is defeated, the game ends. When one opponent is defeated, the opponent who was not defeated wins the game. 

1-2-2. The following are all game conditions that result in defeat. 

1-2-2-1. When either player receives battle damage from a Unit while they have no cards in their shield area, that player fulfills the conditions for defeat. 

1-2-2-2. When either player has no cards remaining in their deck, that player fulfills the conditions for defeat. 

1-2-3. During a game, any player may concede at any time. That player immediately loses and the game ends. 

1-2-4. There are no card effects that force a player to concede. Loss of the game by conceding is never a substitution of any substitution effect. 



1-3. Fundamental Game Rules 

1-3-1. While the rules of the game are fundamentally defined within this comprehensive ruleset, there may be exceptions that arise due a card’s effects or special rules. If the text written on a card contradicts the comprehensive rules, the text on the card takes precedence. 

1-3-2. If a player is required to perform an action that is not possible for any reason, that action is not performed. If a player is required to perform an action and only part of that action is not possible, the player must perform as much of the action as possible. 

1-3-2-1. If you are required to put an entity into some state that entity is already in, the entity remains in the state it was in, and the action putting it into that state is not performed. 

Ex: If you are instructed to rest a Unit that is currently rested, since the Unit is already rested, it is not rested again. 

1-3-2-2. If for any reason you are required to perform zero or less repetitions of an action, the action is not performed. An opposite action is not performed for negative repetition counts. 

1-3-3. When a card’s effect requires an action that an active effect prevents, the active effect takes precedence, and the action is prevented. 

1-3-4. When both players are required for any reason to make a selection simultaneously, the active player chooses first. The standby player chooses after that. 

1-3-5. Unless specified otherwise, when choosing a number for a card or a rule, you must choose a whole number equal to or greater than one. You cannot choose a negative or fractional number. 

1-3-6. When numerical information on a card is modified by a card’s effect, the result will be a whole number. If the result would be negative, treat it as zero unless it will be modified by another effect. 

1-3-7. Unless specified otherwise, a card’s effects are performed in the order they appear in the text on the card.

6-5-2-2-1. Base deployment is the act of paying the cost of a Base card in your hand to play it and deploy it into the base section of the shield area. Some abilities can also deploy Bases from locations other than the hand. 

6-5-2-3. Pilot Pairing 

6-5-2-3-1. Pilot pairing is the act of paying the cost of a Pilot card in your hand to play it and pair it by placing it beneath a Unit already in the battle area. Some abilities can also pair Pilots from locations other than the hand. 

6-5-2-3-2. A Unit paired with a Pilot matching its link conditions is referred to as a Link Unit. 

6-5-2-3-3. A Pilot cannot be paired with a Unit that is already paired with another Pilot. As a rule, a Unit can only have at most one pilot paired with it. 

6-5-2-3-3-1. You cannot freely remove a paired Pilot from a Unit or exchange it with another Pilot. 

6-5-2-3-4. When a Unit paired with a Pilot is destroyed, returned to the hand, or otherwise moved from the battle area to another location, the paired Pilot is moved to the same location as the Unit. 

6-5-2-3-5. Some Command cards have Pilot effects. A Command card with this effect can be paired with a Unit as a Pilot by paying its cost to play it during your main phase. 

6-5-2-4. Activating Command Cards with 【Main】 

6-5-2-4-1. Activating a Command card with 【Main】 is the act of paying the cost of a Command card in your hand with a 【Main】 effect to play it and activate that effect. 

6-5-3. 【Activate･Main】 Activation 

6-5-3-1. Activating an 【Activate･Main】 effect is the act of fulfilling the conditions for an 【Activate･Main】 effect on a card and activating it. 

## 15 

\(See 11-2-1. 【Activate･Main】\) 

6-5-4. Attack with a Unit 

6-5-4-1. Attack with a Unit by attacking the opposing player or a rested enemy Unit with one of your Units in the battle area. \(See 7. Attacking and Battles\) 

6-5-5. End of the Main Phase 

6-5-5-1. In addition to the actions listed above, the active player may declare the end of the main phase during their main phase. 

6-5-5-2. When the end of the main phase is declared, the turn immediately enters the end phase. 

6-6. End Phase 

6-6-1. The end phase consists of four steps, which are performed in order: action step, end step, hand step, and cleanup step. 

6-6-2. Action Step 

6-6-2-1. Taking turns, starting with the standby player, players can activate 

【Action】 Command cards and 【Activate･Action】 effects. \(See 8. 

Action Steps\) 

6-6-3. End Step 

6-6-3-1. Effects that specify “at the end of the turn” activate. 

6-6-4. Hand Step 

6-6-4-1. If the number of cards in your hand exceeds the upper limit of 10, discard cards of your choosing until you only have 10. 

6-6-5. Cleanup Step 

6-6-5-1. Effects with the duration limit “during this turn” lose effect. Resolve any triggered effects or the like which activate as a result. 

6-6-6. After all of the rules listed above have been dealt with, the turn passes to the opponent. 



7. ** **Attacking and Battles 

7-1. Using a main phase attack with a Unit, the active player may use one of their Units to attack the opposing player or a rested enemy Unit in the battle area. 

7-2. An attack with a Unit consists of five steps, which are performed in order: attack step, block step, action step, damage step, battle end step. 

7-3. Attack Step 

7-3-1. Select one active Unit in your battle area and rest it, then declare an attack target. The attack target can be either the opposing player or a rested enemy 16 



Unit. 

7-3-2. 【When Attacking】 effects on the attacking Unit and “when a unit attacks” 

effects on other Units and cards are triggered. If multiple effects trigger, they do so simultaneously, and the active player activates their effects in the order they decide, after which the standby player does the same. 

7-3-3. If activation of a 【When Attacking】 or “when a unit attacks” effect triggers new effects, give those new effects priority and activate them. 

7-3-4. Effects worded “during this battle” gain effect now. 

7-3-5. After resolving all effects activated up to this point, continue to the block step. 

7-3-5-1. At the end of the attack step, if the attacking Unit or the Unit targeted for attack has been destroyed or otherwise moved to another location due to some event, continue to the battle end step rather than the block step. 

7-3-5-2. For 【When Attacking】 effects that include target conditions in their text, such as “when you attack a player” or “when you attack a Unit,” determine whether or not the specified target satisfies those conditions during the attack step. Even if the originally selected target is changed to a different target by another effect, the target after the change does not influence that determination based on the text conditions. 

7-4. Block Step 

7-4-1. The standby player may activate <Blocker> on one of their active Units in the battle area. When activated, this effect changes the attack target of the attacking Unit to the Unit with <Blocker>. 

7-4-2. The <Blocker> effect can be activated only one time in response to each attack. 

7-4-3. A Unit originally targeted for attack cannot activate its own <Blocker> effect. 

7-4-4. Choosing not to activate a <Blocker> effect is also allowed. 

7-4-5. When you have resolved all effects activated during this step, continue to the action step. 

7-4-5-1. At the end of the block step, if the attacking Unit or the Unit targeted for attack has been destroyed or otherwise moved to another location due to some event, continue to the battle end step rather than the action step. 

## 17 

7-5. Action Step 

7-5-1. Taking turns starting with the standby player, players may activate 【Action】 

Command cards and 【Activate･Action】 effects. \(See 8. Action Steps\) 7-5-2. If both players have declared they are passing, end the action step and continue to damage step. 

7-5-2-1. At the end of the action step, if the attacking Unit or the Unit targeted for attack has been destroyed or otherwise moved to another location due to some event, continue to the battle end step rather than the damage step. 

7-6. Damage Step 

7-6-1. Confirm the attacking Unit’s attack target at this point. 

7-6-1-1. If the attack target is a player, an attack on a player succeeds. 

7-6-1-2. If the attack target is an enemy Unit, an attack on a Unit succeeds. 

7-6-2. Attack on a Player 

7-6-2-1. After an attack on a player has succeeded, check the opponent’s shield area. 

7-6-2-2. If there is no Base and not a single Shield in the opponent’s shield area, the attacking Unit deals battle damage equal to its AP to the opposing player. A player receiving damage is immediately defeated, and the player who owns the attacking Unit wins the game. 

7-6-2-3. If there is a Base in the enemy shield area, the attacking Unit deals an amount of battle damage equal to its AP to the Base targeted for attack. 

7-6-2-3-1. Use counters to track damage received. If the Base’s HP 

becomes zero, it is destroyed and placed into the trash. 

7-6-2-3-2. If the attacking Unit has <First Strike>, it deals battle damage to the enemy Base before normal battle damage is managed. 

\(See 11-1-5. <First Strike>\) 

7-6-2-4. If there is a Shield but no Base in the enemy shield area, the attacking Unit deals damage equal to its AP to the top Shield in the shield section of the shield area. 

7-6-2-4-1. The Shield receiving damage is destroyed. Place the card into the trash after revealing it. If the revealed card has a 【Burst】 

effect, the owner chooses whether or not to activate it. 

7-6-2-5. When you have resolved all effects activated during this step, continue to the battle end step. 

7-6-3. Attack on a Unit 

## 18 

7-6-3-1. If an attack on a Unit succeeds, conduct a battle between the two Units. 

7-6-3-2. The attacking Unit deals damage equal to its AP to the Unit targeted for attack simultaneously as the Unit targeted for attack deals damage equal to its AP to the Attacking Unit. 

7-6-3-2-1. Use counters to track damage received. If a Unit’s HP 

becomes zero, it is destroyed and placed into the trash. 

7-6-3-2-2. If the attacking Unit has <First Strike>, it deals battle damage to the enemy Unit before normal battle damage is managed. 

\(See 11-1-5. <First Strike>\) 

7-6-3-2-3. If both battling Units are destroyed, their destruction is treated as happening simultaneously. 

7-6-3-3. When you have resolved all effects activated during this step, continue to the battle end step. 

7-7. Battle End Step 

7-7-1. All effects worded “during this battle” lose effect. 

7-7-2. When you have resolved all effects activated during this step, the battle ends, and you return to the main phase. \(See 6-5. Main Phase\) 8. ** **Action Steps 

8-1. An action step occurs after the block step and during the end phase. 

8-2. During an action step, taking turns starting with the standby player, players may activate 【Action】 Command cards and 【Activate･Action】 effects. 

8-3. The standby player may choose to perform one of the following actions: activate an 

【Action】 Command card, activate an 【Activate･Action】 effect, or pass. 

8-3-1. Activating an 【Action】 Command card is the act of paying the cost of a Command card in your hand with an 【Action】 effect to play it and activate that effect. 

8-3-2. Activating an 【 Activate ･ Action 】 effect is the act of fulfilling the conditions for an 【Activate･Action】 effect on a card and activating it. 

8-3-3. Pass means doing nothing and letting the right to take an action pass to your opponent. 

8-4. Next, the active player may choose one of the following actions: activate an 

【Action】 Command card, activate an 【Activate･Action】 effect, or pass. 

8-4-1. Unless both players have consecutively declared that they are passing, the right to take an action once again passes back to the standby player. 

## 19 

8-4-2. Continue in this manner, standby player → active player → standby player and so on, until both players consecutively declare they are passing. 

8-5. When both players have consecutively declared they are passing, the action step ends. 



9. ** **Effect Activation and Resolution 

9-1. Effects 

9-1-1. An effect consists of a directive and related compensation which originate from the text on a card. 

9-1-2. Unless the text specifies otherwise, an effect will only affect cards in the battle area. If a location for where to activate the effect is not specified, an effect on a Unit or Base can only be activated while that card is in the battle area. 

9-1-3. Some effects instruct you to perform them, while others state “you may” 

perform them. If instructed to perform an effect, perform as much of it as possible. If told “you may” perform an effect, you may also choose not to activate that effect. 

9-1-4. Effects are divided into five types, depending on their contents and trigger conditions: constant, triggered, activated, command, and substitution. 

9-1-5. Constant Effects 

9-1-5-1. A constant effect is an effect that remains constantly active in some form. 

9-1-5-2. A constant effect will remain active the entire time it is in a location where it activates. 

9-1-5-3. Some constant effects only activate while certain conditions are fulfilled. As long as they are in a location where they activate and those conditions are fulfilled, they will remain active the entire time. 

9-1-5-4. Constant effects do not wait to be triggered or activated. They are active from the moment they enter the location where they activate. 

9-1-5-5. When multiple constant effects are active, they will all overlap. 

9-1-5-6. When multiple constant effects with conflicting contents are active, effects that state other effects “can’t” have an effect, or otherwise disallow them, take precedence. 

9-1-5-7. A constant effect with a conditional target is applied the moment a target fulfilling those conditions appears. 

9-1-6. Triggered Effects 

## 20 

9-1-6-1. A triggered effect activates automatically when some conditional event occurs during the game. Triggered effects include effects that specify timing, such as 【 Deploy 】 , 【 When Attacking 】 , 

【Destroyed】, and 【When Paired】. They also include effects that include a condition such as “when \(some event occurs\)” in their text. 

9-1-6-1-1. In the absence of a restriction, such as 【Once per Turn】, the effect activates every time the condition is fulfilled. 

9-1-6-2. A triggered effect will not trigger or activate unless its trigger conditions are fulfilled. 

9-1-6-3. If multiple events fulfilling a trigger condition occur simultaneously, the effect will only trigger and activate one time. 

9-1-6-4. If a card with a triggered effect leaves the location where it is active while that effect is waiting to be activated after it was triggered, the effect still activates. 

9-1-6-5. If multiple effects belonging to you trigger, they do so simultaneously, and you resolve them in the order you decide. 

9-1-6-6. If multiple effects belonging to both you and your opponent trigger, they do so simultaneously, and the active player resolves their effects in the order they decide, after which the standby player does the same. 

9-1-6-7. If a new effect triggers while multiple effects are being resolved, give that new effect priority and resolve it. 

9-1-6-8. If multiple effects trigger and a 【Burst】 effect is among them, give that 【Burst】 effect priority over all others and resolve it first. 

9-1-7. Activated Effects 

9-1-7-1. An activated effect can be freely activated by the player. These include 【Activate･Main】 and 【Activate･Action】 effects. 

9-1-7-2. When an activated effect’s timing permits activation, satisfying the actions described before the colon will activate the effect described after the colon. 

9-1-7-3. Some activated effects specify the symbol “①” as a condition. When this symbol appears, paying a cost equal to the number printed within the symbol satisfies the condition and allows the effect to be activated. 

9-1-7-4. Some activated effects have two or more conditions which appear as 

“【Activate･Action】 \(condition 1\), \(condition 2\)：.” In this case, satisfying all of the conditions will activate the effect described following the colon. 

## 21 

9-1-7-5. If an activated effect has neither a colon nor conditions for activating it listed, you can activate it by declaring you are doing so. 

9-1-8. Command Effects 

9-1-8-1. A command effect activates when it is played during the timing specified on a Command card, which can be either 【Main】, or 

【Action】, or both. 

9-1-8-1-1. If a command effect requires choosing a target, playing that Command card is not possible if that target cannot be chosen. 

9-1-9. Substitution Effects 

9-1-9-1. When some event would occur, a substitution effect replaces the implementation of that event with another event. 

9-1-9-1-1. If an effect reads “\(do\) B instead of A,” the portion B that occurs due to that capability is a substitution effect. 

9-2. Effect Conditions 

9-2-1. When certain conditions are required for an effect to activate, it will not activate unless those conditions are fulfilled. 

9-2-2. If an effect requires choosing a target, that effect will not activate if the target cannot be chosen. 

9-2-3. Even if an effect’s conditions are fulfilled, that effect will not activate if it is restricted by an effect that disallows it. 

9-3. Effect Activation Steps 

9-3-1. When activating an effect, follow the steps listed below. 

9-3-1-1. If conditions are required to activate the effect, they must be fulfilled, otherwise the effect cannot be activated. 

9-3-1-2. Declare you are activating the effect. If the effect is on a card in your hand and can be activated at that time, reveal the card. 

9-3-1-3. Activate the declared effect. 

9-3-1-4. Resolve all events which occur in response to activating the effect. 

9-3-2. If the effect you wish to activate is on a Command card, present the card and perform the effect listed on it. 

9-3-3. When a Command card is played or a triggered effect is triggered and its effect instructs you to “choose 1 \(card or player\)” or “choose up to \(some number of cards\),” those targets are chosen at the point in time when the instructions appear in the effect. 

9-3-3-1. If an effect’s target cannot be chosen, that effect does not activate. 

9-3-4. If a number to choose is specified, you must choose as many of the indicated 22 



cards or players as possible, up to and including that number. 

9-3-5. If the text of an effect does not specifically indicate choosing a card or player and the effect is meant to target a card, the card generating the effect is indicated. If the effect is meant to target a player, the player who owns the card generating the effect is indicated. 

9-3-6. When choosing a card from the deck, confirm the top of the deck, then choose the specified card from it. 



10. ** **Rules Management 

10-1. Rules Management Fundamentals 

10-1-1. Rules management is management stipulated within the rules that automatically takes place when a specific event occurs or is occurring during a game. 

10-1-2. Immediately resolve rules management the moment an event occurs, regardless of if other actions are being performed. 

10-2. Determination of Defeat Management 

10-2-1. At the start of rules management, if any player fulfills a condition for defeat, all players fulfilling a condition for defeat are immediately defeated. 

10-2-1-1. When any player receives battle damage from a Unit while they have no cards in their shield area, that player fulfills a condition for defeat. 

10-2-1-2. When any player has no cards in their deck, that player fulfills a condition for defeat. 

10-3. Destruction Management 

10-3-1. When the HP of a Unit, Base, or Shield becomes zero less after receiving damage, that Unit, Base, or Shield is destroyed. The destroyed card is placed into the trash. 

10-3-1-1. Shields are treated as having 1 HP each. 

10-4. Battle Area Excess Management 

10-4-1. Units in the battle area are limited to six at most. 

10-4-2. If the battle area is at its upper limit when a Unit card is being played or a Unit is being deployed by an effect, choose one Unit already in the battle area and place it into the trash. 

10-4-2-1. Units placed into the trash due to this management are not considered to be destroyed. 

10-4-2-2. When multiple Units are deployed simultaneously, place an equal number of Units already in the battle area into the trash. 

## 23 

10-5. Managing Shield Area Base Section Excess 10-5-1. The base section of the shield area is limited to one Base at most. 

10-5-2. If the base section of the shield area is full when a new Base card is played or a new Base is deployed by some effect, choose one Base already in the base section of the shield area and place it into the trash. 

10-5-2-1. Bases placed into the trash due to this management are not considered to be destroyed.

11-1-1-3. The <Repair> effect does not activate unless damage has been received. 

11-1-1-4. If a Unit with <Repair> is given a new copy of <Repair> by some effect, rather than gaining multiple copies, the amount from the new copy of <Repair> is added to the original. 

Ex: If a Unit with <Repair 1> is given <Repair 2>, the <Repair> effect on that Unit becomes <Repair 3>. 

11-1-2. <Breach> 

11-1-2-1. <Breach> is a keyword effect that deals damage to the enemy’s shield area when the Unit with <Breach> destroys an enemy Unit with battle damage. It only activates during your turn.

11-1-2-4. It activates even when both Units are destroyed in battle. 

11-1-2-5. If there is neither a Base nor Shields in the enemy’s shield area, the 

<Breach> effect does not activate. 

## 24 

11-1-2-6. If a Unit with <Breach> is given a new copy of <Breach> by some effect, rather than gaining multiple copies, the amount from the new copy of <Breach> is added to the original.

11-1-3-3. If a Unit with <Support> is given a new copy of <Support> by some effect, rather than gaining multiple copies, the amount from the new copy of <Support> is added to the original. 

Ex: If a Unit with <Support 1> is given <Support 2>, the <Support> effect on that Unit becomes <Support 3>. 

11-1-4. <Blocker> 

11-1-4-1. <Blocker> is a keyword effect that can change the attack target to the Unit with <Blocker> when you declare a block and rest that Unit.

11-1-5-1. <First Strike> is a keyword effect that deals damage before the enemy does when the attacking Unit battles. 

11-1-5-2. Dealing damage before the enemy means battle damage is dealt before normal management occurs during the damage step \(7-6\). If the enemy Unit or Base is destroyed by this battle damage, battle damage from the enemy's AP is not received. 

11-1-5-3. If the enemy Unit or Base is destroyed by damage dealt by <First Strike> before normal damage management, continue to the battle end step \(7-7\) after resolving all effects activated by battle damage and the resulting destruction. 

11-1-5-4. Multiple copies of <First Strike> cannot be given to the same Unit. 

11-1-6. <High-Maneuver> 

11-1-6-1. <High-Maneuver> is a keyword effect that prevents the <Blocker> effect on enemy Units from activating while the Unit with <High-Maneuver> is attacking.
